ouija_origin_of_evil,"A fake psychic purchases a Ouija board game and is soon made aware the spiritual realm is real...and evil.

An entertaining horror flick from Flanagan, who has done such things as Fall of the House of Usher and The Haunting of Hill House series.  Despite my esteem for those shows this was my first viewing of one of his films.   It was interesting to see how he can focus the story a little over an hour and a half when he usually has hours to work his magic.  It's a well done traditional scary movie and excels in that regard.

ouija_origin_of_evil,"Flanagan's ""Ouija"" is a typical film about demonic possession, but well-structured, with well-developed characters and dialogue, an atmosphere created with the director's typical elements such as lighting and smooth camera movements, and horror scenes built up through excellent technique, the right tension and a pinch of irony.","Oct 11, 2023",Vito P,4

ouija_origin_of_evil,"A pesar de la poca aceptación que tuvo la película anterior, eso no impidió que Blumhouse y Hasbro nos trajeran esta precuela que técnicamente está un poco mejor que su predecesora, aunque existen algunas cosas que son un poco difíciles de encajar con la película anterior. Después de verla toda y empezar a hacer la comparativa con la película anterior, llega el momento de preguntarse si todo lo narrado en esta película ocurrió al cien por ciento o si se trata solo de una narración con partes alteradas por parte de quien ha estado narrando todo. Lo cierto es que mientras la película anterior es mucho más cliché y random, esta precuela es mucho más consistente. El guion está bien estructurado y tiene un mejor elenco. El estilo de los años 60 le da una buena pinta y al menos el argumento posee algunos elementos que hacían falta en la primera película. La historia de origen que narra esta película logra profundizar mejor sobre las fuerzas del mal que son invocadas por la ouija. En conclusión, esta película es una mejora que la saga necesitaba y hubiera sido más conveniente que esta película hubiese sido la primera entrega de la saga. Mi calificación final para esta película es un 8/10.","Sep 17, 2023",Elvis D,4

ouija_origin_of_evil,"A Lackluster Haunting: Unveiling the Mediocrity of 'Ouija: Origin of Evil'

Well, well, well, where do I even begin with this so-called ""Ouija Origin of Evil""? Let's just say, this movie was a solid 6 out of 10 on my scale – and by solid, I mean it was okay, but nothing to write home about. Now, before you get all defensive about your beloved supernatural flick, let me explain why I feel this way.

First of all, let's talk about the plot. A widow and her two daughters using an Ouija board to help people move on with life? Come on, really? I mean, I've heard of unconventional therapies, but this takes it to a whole new level. It's like they're trying to combine therapy and spiritualism in the most bizarre way possible. And to make matters worse, they interact with a spirit that ends up possessing Doris, the youngest daughter. Classic mistake, right?

Now, I don't know about you, but when I sit down to watch a horror movie, I want to be scared out of my wits. I want shivers down my spine and to be afraid of the dark for weeks on end. But unfortunately, ""Ouija Origin of Evil"" failed to deliver on that front. The scares were so cliché and predictable that I found myself saying, ""Oh, look, another jump scare. How original.""

And let's not even get started on the setting. 1967 Los Angeles? Really? I get it, the retro vibes can be cool, but this just felt forced. It's like they were desperately trying to ride the nostalgia wave, but it ended up falling flat. I mean, come on, couldn't they have chosen a more unique and interesting location?

But perhaps what disappoints me the most is how this movie never quite lives up to its potential. With such an intriguing premise, I was expecting a rollercoaster ride of emotions and a deep exploration of the human psyche. Instead, I was met with a half-hearted attempt to scare the audience and a plot that seemed to be riddled with inconsistencies.

All in all, ""Ouija Origin of Evil"" was a letdown. It didn't live up to the hype, the scares were lackluster, and the plot felt underdeveloped. But hey, at least it provided some unintentional laughs and a few hours of mindless entertainment. So, if you're looking for a movie to kill some time and have a few chuckles, give it a shot. Just don't expect a masterpiece, because trust me, this ain't it.

ouija_origin_of_evil,"A lot of the elements in this movie hit really well, and a lot of them didn't. The movie struggles to keep the suspense as the movie gets closer to the end. The special effects lacked and took me out of the movie multiple times.","Apr 19, 2023",Dan B,3

malignant_2021,"Slasher, horror movie with a bizarre premise I'd never seen before. Neat how it takes the supernatural into the real world. Of course it's got plenty of nonsensical stuff and most of the time it's ridiculous. You have to take it for what it is. Just silly horror. You must suspend every piece of rationale thinking you possess before watching.","Apr 1, 2024",Angel N,3

malignant_2021,"Wow, this was terrible. The effects get cheesier as the movie goes on and on, notice I didn't say progress because it's never ending. The characters keep switching between it's a parasitic twin and it's a demon, it's honestly ridiculous. There are multiple times in the movie with plot holes. For example if Gabriel is part of Emily, how did the detective get a phone call from Gabriel while interviewing Emily? Also when Emily is asked how she talked to Gabriel, she says through the devil. Even the script is terrible. I genuinely feel bad for everyone who spent their time on this movie.","Feb 2, 2024",Sheena S,0

malignant_2021,"Um excelente filme de terror, tem uma direção que se destaca muito, com certeza um dos melhores trabalhos de James Wan no terror, onde ele consegue criar todo o ambiente e causar um terror psicológico grande antes de qualquer susto, sem contar com algumas cenas de ação e porradaria muito bem dirigidas. Talvez o filme acaba decaindo tratando-se do roteiro, mas no geral é um bom filme de terror/suspense.","Jan 21, 2024",JoÃ£o B,3
malignant_2021,"Malignant was fun at times, the first hour or so was fairly eerie then it became a little desperate & cheesy with a few good fight scenes. The only chills I got were from the very ropey acting. More suspense & less boring blood & gore would have been a much better direction but that's all subjective.","Jan 20, 2024",Jon,2
malignant_2021,"Terrible dialogue, terrible music, the actors deserved more to work with.","Jan 15, 2024",Metal T,2
malignant_2021,"I really enjoyed this. I like horror movies with character who have forgotten their memories, or have something buried from the past, that eventually comes back to haunt them. I also found the research they were doing on the young girl to add to the horror of this movie. That instead of helping this child they studied her, and now it has affected her future. While the huge action scene near the end was over the top and others are saying it is not realistic, it is a fictional movie and it was exciting to watch. If you like horror movies with a twist, with creepy medical incidents, or main character's unwanted memories from the past surfacing and wreaking havoc on their life, I would definitely recommend this movie. My only complaint is the abrupt ending, I would've liked to known what happened to the detectives and what became of Madison next.","Jan 12, 2024",ScarletSerena K,4

bird_box,While quiet place was the better one bird box is still enjoyable enough to watch even if it could have been better,"Mar 6, 2024",Spike G,3
bird_box,"This is a somewhat effective, frequently engaging but not particularly memorable thriller that many will undoubtedly compare to the superior A QUIET PLACE which opened earlier in the year. Supporting characters and performances range from good to overwrought, and I didn't think the non-linear framing device was necessary or particularly enhanced the experience. It's certainly a good time-passer on a snowy afternoon, but I doubt you'll remember much about it a day or two later. SPOILER ALERT: Just a note to filmmakers in the future - when you have a priceless commodity like Sarah Paulson, don't relegate her to a glorified cameo.","Feb 11, 2024",Jeff M,3

bird_box,"This movie had more potential than it was able to accomplish, it plays with the idea that people can't see in clever ways, but seems to fall apart by the end. Also it tries to explain its monster, while still keeping it mysterious, that rarely works, and it didn't.","Nov 26, 2023",Raiodesol S,2
bird_box,"Sandra Bullock protagoniza este thriller que es una historia apocalíptica vista en otras películas, pero con algo mucho más original que no se ha visto en otras películas de este tipo. Aquí la humanidad es víctima de una amenaza indescriptible que genera locura en aquellos quienes la ven. Se trata de algo que no se puede ver o enfrentar cara a cara y ni siquiera se le muestra al espectador que es esta entidad. La película presenta un enemigo invisible que no se puede describir y solo queda bajo la imaginación de la audiencia. La verdad eso hace que la película sea bastante intrigante y que haga a los nuevos espectadores preguntarse como van a sobrevivir a algo con lo que no pueden tener contacto visual. Eso hace que la película se sienta como algo al nivel del horror cósmico. Es bastante sencilla y cuenta con una interesante banda sonora por parte de dos miembros de la banda Nine Inch Nails. Bird Box no es diferente de otras películas con temática apocalíptica, pero su concepto de una amenaza que no se puede ver hace que sea algo distinto, haciéndola única a su manera. Mi calificación final para esta película es un 8/10.","Nov 24, 2023",Elvis D,4

bird_box,"I think Bird Box is a justifiably polarizing movie, and you should take each review with a pinch of salt. I wouldn't consider this film underwhelming because it effectively builds tension and suspense, and I think those are key elements to successfully delivering a horror flick. It may also not rank as one of the finest movies due to its ineffective structure and the shortcomings in its narrative credibility. The movie is unlike a lot of its horror counterparts because it doesn't rely on a tangible threat to drive its story. This makes it harder to put ourselves in the characters' shoes and thoroughly assess the situations they're thrust in. It also feeds the uneasiness that the movie so badly wants you to feel. You might argue that it also allows the writers to get away with certain loopholes. To that, I say not everything requires laid-out answers. You could also tell that the film isn't very invested in the logistics of things. It's more concerned with painting a portrait of humanity in the face of a world-ending event. Admittedly, other productions have done a better job, but those efforts aren't fruitless here. I was completely entertained. Bird Box is an entertaining take on sci-fi horror with its interesting premise, unsettling atmosphere and wonderful performances from its cast.","Sep 19, 2023",Arnold O,4
bird_box,"I honestly wish I'd read the book to this because this is a very good idea, just badly executed. This takes place in the not-so-distant future where an emergency situation occurs. People must stay inside as they can be easily killed by hallucinations they see and hear. Sandra Bullock is a woman who was pregnant at the time of this emergency who found shelter with several others. Her husband died in the initial chaos. She gave birth at the same time as another woman but shortly after the other woman's birth, she looked out the window which caused her to die. Now Sandra Bullock cares for both her child and the virtual stranger's. She hears of a safer place for herself and her children and readies herself with ear plugs and blindfolds for the three and is traveling by boat to what she hopes is salvation. I just personally didn't find any of the ""monsters"" they showed to be threatening. It's also not a unique concept to have horror movie monsters be able to mimic voices of loved ones long dead. It is also extremely unrealistic that a woman with two six year olds would be able to navigate anywhere blindfolded and with ear plugs. It's not like a horror movie needs to be realistic but this read more survival story which I feel should be somewhat realistic.","Sep 19, 2023",Carson C,2

bird_box,"Elements of A Quiet Place and The Silence run throughout, as the premises each share similarities. Unfortunately, this shares none of their tension and suspense.

the_rental_2020,"Some of it feels familiar, but there is enough depth and atmosphere to make it different. I like that you're left with a lot of questions, and don't really know what's going on. I think the main issue dragging it down is that  you're not rooting for anyone. Each character ranges from obnoxious to full on scummy.

the_rental_2020,"It's a mix of drama and horror. The build-up of suspense during the first hour pulled me in, but the ending really lets the air out of the balloon.

the_rental_2020,"The Rental touches on some sensitive societal issues which might explain why it is receiving lower ratings than it deserves. But like one of the protagonists says while driving to the rental: ""discrimination still exists"". If you have a problem with ""wokeness"" 😪, then go watch a different movie. For the rest of us who can enjoy a good horror movie without getting our feel feels hurt, this movie is pretty good. The actors are pleasing to look at. The dialogue is fantastic. Some nudity, a butt crack and some sexual infidelity. Plus a fair amount of physical violence, and a general sense of discomfort until the action starts. It's a medium burn. It is not slow, but it isn't fast paced either.To be critical, the movie tends to borrow from the commonly done trope of people being stranded out in the wilderness and there's somebody spying on them. Maybe even reminiscent of I Know what you Did Last Summer when the protagonists are panicking because there's a corpse that needs to be done away with.  But, I'd rather be positive and say that it hits on the checklist most of what is necessary to make a good horror movie.

I give it 5 rainbow dildos and certify that it is gay AF. Wouldn't recommend. You'd be better off watching literally anything else.

the_rental_2020,"I'm glade they allow half start ratings here, because I think this is exactly the kind of film that thing is for. It's clearly better than average (3 stars). But it's definitely not awesome either. It does what it does so well, but it takes so long getting there that it really feels like it should have been part of a anthology series and cut to 1 hour. But I think the extra time makes their situation more believable, to an extent. Despite the beginning being well done, well acted, well shot, etc, it just feels a bit boring. There's such a thing as too subtle and too slow burn. Once it gets going it's good, especially for a horror film, it feels wonderfully more hitchcock than most slasher films these days. But it took so long getter there. If only they'd shortened the beginning a bit and lengthened the end a bit. And I'm not sure horror fans will be pleased, since it's more subtle than most of those, which I'm happy about, since I'm not into modern horror much, but horror fans may be let down. Thriller fans might be bored. But if you're a fan of drama and thrillers, this is a nice two for one. But in the end, despite the good acting (I'm a big Alison Brie fan) and the more subtle take on the genre, I will likely forget I watched this film. I would be interested in seen another film by the director in the future, he's got a good take here that's worth exploring and refining. If it catches on, heck, I'll even be a horror movie fan. But I think it might have done better as part of a horror anthology series with a 15 minute shorter running time.","Sep 8, 2023",Nathaniel C,3

But Jesse Buckley, Jeez. And Plemons. 

And Collette? How can this not be an amazing film? And it is. 

Painful, joyful, insightful, and mysterious. Lovely, panic attack-inducing, and unforgettable. Profoundly truthful, and difficult to escape after it ends. But worth the experience, far, far and again, worth it. 

Plus, David Thewlis steals scenes with just a glance, or a wave of his hand. 

Toni Collette has been burning up screens and scenes for a long time, and I've always gravitated toward her work. And then I saw Hereditary. After that, I've given her (ticket) money any time I could find an excuse.

im_thinking_of_ending_things,"This is not an action film, nor is it a romantic story. It's a surreal thriller. It tells the story of two lonely people in a relationship. He takes her in his car to meet her parents who live in a remote farm. Most scenes are filmed at night during a blizzard, giving the movie a gloomy atmosphere. Nothing particularly remarkable happens in this story, except for the ending that is a succession of surrealistic, seemingly incomprehensible scenes. I think this is the part that contains the great meaning that the film intends to transmit — even if it is a metaphor that for most people is almost impossible to solve. However, —whether we like it or not— this film has some artistic merits. The atmosphere is excellent, the visual effects are good, the feeling of loneliness and isolation is permanent and the dialogues are very natural. In the end, these images will remain for a time in the mind of the viewer.","Nov 24, 2023",Luis M. D,4

It doesn't deserve all the 1 stars it's getting from people who are confused and prefer mindless entertainment. 
But if you enjoy movies with lots of dialogue and puzzling things out or movies that make you feel like you're in a surreal dream state, this movie will really make you wonder as you slowly try to piece everything out. 
While you may not feel happy or giddy while watching, it draws you in and makes you feel like the character. It does exactly what it's supposed to do in making you relate to them while feeling the same sort of dread, indifference, and dreamlike confusion. 
Even after it ends, you still find yourself lost in your own thoughts.

im_thinking_of_ending_things,"Charlie Kaufman fully delivers on the surrealism expected from his earlier work with ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things,"" a film that keeps the audience perpetually in suspense and dread without ever explaining why. Right from the beginning, when Jake (Jesse Plemons) interrupts the Young Woman's (an outstandingly unnerving Jessie Buckley) internal monologue and seems to know what she's thinking, the audience can feel the existential dread felt by the Young Woman—and Jake.

The film only gets better from the beginning, expertly utilizing what little is revealed through tremendous performances (Toni Collette is, as always, particularly mesmerizing), haunting visuals, and claustrophobic cinematography to ratchet up suspense until the hair-raising climax. Indeed, the slow pacing may be off-putting for some viewers, but hanging through until the end will leave the audience with more satisfaction than almost every other movie out of Hollywood today.

While not a traditional horror, thriller, or drama film, it can still be easily classified as such, elevating all genres to new heights through a careful, poetic meditation on loneliness, regret, and delusion. If you grasp the ending, the film leaves a beautiful scar in your heart, and if you don't, you still leave with the lingering dread the film is so excellently steeped in.","Oct 20, 2023",Cameron P,5

apostle_2018,"The users are getting it wrong this time. Apostle is a masterpiece of folklore horror, and I was absorbed every inch of the way. Thomas (Dan Stevens), an already deeply troubled soul, makes this one right decision in his life (to rescue his sister), and it proves to be his undoing. But it's also his salvation, as he endures so much due to his love for her, and finds a peculiar happiness at the end. What's fascinating about the horror and gore is that it feels so real, meaning nothing is gratuitous. It all fits like perfect puzzle pieces in this fantastical world, and it actually elevates the Thomas character, played to perfection by Stevens. By the way, I can't believe Dan Stevens is the same actor who played the hilarious Russian singer in the comedy Eurovision. One usually sees him in more brooding roles, but his comic chops are razor sharp. But I digress. I loved Apostle, period. And it gets better with repeated viewings.","Jan 5, 2024",Mary Ann F,5

apostle_2018,"A community can only be as pure as the intentions of those who form it. This movie focusses on an island community initially formed by those shunned and exiled from the mainland due to their crimes and misdeeds. The ideals of living with no taxation, no crime, and with a true spirit of mercy and sustainability, are all masking impurity, vindictive motivations, and power-hungry figureheads who have grown the population by the torturous feeding of the island's goddess - imprisoned by the founders when they first arrived. It's a violent, imaginative gothic tale, with plenty to think on thanks to the brainpower of Gareth Evans. The cast are superb, as is the cinematography. It's one I had to rewatch to truly appreciate its depth and beauty as a film. I'm glad I did","Nov 1, 2023",Dave C,4
apostle_2018,"""Apostle"" seems to check all the boxes of a good modern horror movie: a rural, period setting; a dark, depressing atmosphere; a religious cult not afraid of some gore. Indeed, these are films I usually enjoy watching—and precedents like ""The Witch"" did not disappoint. But under this timely premise comes a middling movie content to coast on disappointing tropes rather than fulfilling the promise of its genre of elevated horror.

Dan Stevens stars—but falls flat—as Thomas Richardson, a grizzled man who infiltrates a mysterious island community to rescue his sister Jennifer (Elen Rhys). However, he is soon roped into the gruesome practices of the cult, led by the mysterious Prophet Malcolm (Michael Sheen) and Her (Sharon Morgan), the goddess of the island. The film has so many avenues to explore that it ends up taste-testing them all, to unsavory effect. Between Thomas and Jennifer, to the cult's practices, to a townsman Quinn (Mark Lewis Jones) plotting a coup d'état against Malcolm, to the failing crops tied to the mysterious goddess, the film whiplashes between plots without letting them simmer. To compensate for this narrative bokeh, ruthless gore is thrown in—and while I'm not one to shy away from movie violence, how unnecessary this cult's gore felt was off-putting, to say it mildly.

While the movie has an excellent atmosphere and does put some new spins on the shopworn genre of cultish horror, splatter-film-level gore and an insufficiently unique final product drag this film into the bog of averageness. Ultimately, this visually haunting but narratively jumbled period piece fits right in with the most mediocre entries of the ""Saw"" franchise.","Oct 25, 2023",Cameron P,2

Whenever it was convenient, something that had zero connection to the story thus far, was introduced. The creators of south park would call that the ""and then, and then, and then,"" issue with writing where it should be ""but, therefore."" The cinematography was uninspired. Just seemed to be there for functionality over having a signature looking and feel. Acting was fantastic so kudos to proper casting. I will NEVER watch it again. Just kept getting to be more and more a waste of time.","Sep 23, 2023",Joshua Y,2
apostle_2018,"Apostle is very underrated, judging by some of the audience reviews. Giving this film less than 1 out of 5 stars, for example, is a joke. The cinematography and 1900s period details, along with strong performances by the likes of Michael Sheen, deserve much more than such a derisory score on their own. There is also a lot of good atmosphere-building here, especially in the first half of the movie, wherein our protagonist infiltrates and investigates a sinister island cult, trying to free his sister from their clutches. For me, Apostle loses its stride a bit in its latter stages, falling back on bloody brutality for much of its shock value, the mysteries of the island never culminating in the most satisfying or rewarding of ways. A little less blood and a more substantive payoff would've gone a long way to making this a full 5/5.","Sep 19, 2023",John C,3

1922_2017,"This is one of the more unusual Stephen King movie adaptations, but I think it might be one of my favorites. It's based on a novella published in his collection ""Full Dark, No Stars"". What makes it unusual is that the horror and supernatural elements of the story are the least interesting thing here and, with a little tweaking, could have been excised entirely. Instead, I was drawn in by the power and eventual heartbreak of the story itself and the destruction that falls upon Jane's Wilfred James. The horror aspects almost seem like an afterthought here. I suppose this is more akin to something like DOLORES CLAIBORNE, a woefully underrated King adaptation, than anything else I can think of in his ouvre. Jane is not an actor with whom I'm overly familiar, but he carries the film beautifully, and he succeeds in making us care about him even when his actions are reprehensible. This is certainly one of the more dramatically impactful King adaptations, and while not on the level of something like CARRIE, it's definitely a winner.

It's not a horror movie but there's some quality gore effects and some creepiness (but honestly, it fell a bit flat here).  There are a few choices that I think make it a bit campy or over the top (a crucified cat) but overall it's just a decent movie to watch when you're looking for something decent to watch. While based on a real detective Sarchie who went from a NYPD detective to demonologist, most of the story is fictional with a few details of cases he was involved in sprinkled throughout, but regardless, it was still a decent movie to watch.  Eric Bana and Edgar Ramirez are great, Sean Harris does an awesome job as a possessed veteran, but I think Olivia Munn's character was underwhelming (not her fault).  In fact, I'd say that the fact that all of the female characters were either weak and/or used as objects was an obvious flaw with this movie. Otherwise, take it for what it is, a decent movie to watch that isn't an Oscar winner or unique in any real way...just entertaining.","Sep 26, 2022",nina m,3
deliver_us_from_evil_2014,"I love movies, especially those of the Horror genre because there are so few who get it right So when I find one that I enjoyed, I like to share it.  I'm in no means a prof critic (because they all are a bunch of pretentious douche-nozzles who are so detached from real society that they wouldn't know whata good film was if it bit them in the ass). I'm definitely classify as a fan and I know what I like.  I really enjoyed this film even though I had no idea it even existed up until I watched it Channel surfing through insomnia. The worst thing about this film is it's over used and corny title.  That said it's creepy as hell, gore level = blood filled, thrilling... check, campy... just enough. It's easy to follow, and I believe the casting was spot on. I'm not the biggest Eric Bana fan, but he totally delivers as Detective Sarchie, as does Edgar Ramirez as Fr. Mendoza. Sean Harris is perfectly creepy and makes you believe he's possessed. Olivia Munn does as Olivia Munn often do👍, and Joel McHale is even believable as Butler.

white_noise_2022,"I'm sure this is well done - and I'm not expecting to enjoy it in the slightest.  I'm not expecting to hate it either, just to find it a somewhat dry and literary chore.  Here's hoping to being proved wrong...

Well, having watched it, I wouldn't describe it as dry and literary.  In fact, I'm not at all sure how I would describe it.  I feel it's probably trying to say something clever about environmental matters or fear or death, but I'm completely confused as to what that might be.  I'm going to give you what some might consider spoilers, but I suspect they'll be very unlikely to spoil anything for anyone.  

Adam Driver plays Jack Gladney, who is married to Babette and they have four kids from various marriages.  Jack is a professor of Hitler studies, yet speaks no German and Babette is taking a drug that no-one has any information about.  They're both concerned about death, which isn't helped by a train crash which causes a toxic cloud to be released so they all have to evacuate to a summer camp.  And then they go home again and it turns out Babette has been sleeping with a guy to get this drug, so Jack goes to shoot him which ends up with them going to see some nuns who find the idea of God ridiculous.  And then they all have a dance in a supermarket.

It's all very stylish, but it makes not a single jot of sense.  Not a jot.  Seriously, this makes ABSOLUTELY no sense at all - not to me at least.  It's also incredibly wordy, which when it makes no sense gets very tiresome.  I didn't entirely hate it because I was quite intrigued to see if it was going to make any sense - but when it didn't, I did feel a bit annoyed that it had wasted my time.

The acting seems quite hammy at times, but given the quality of the actors involved and the general lack of sense, I feel like they're doing what they've been told to do - but maybe they just shouldn't have.  The kids all acquit themselves well enough given that Adam Driver and Greta Gerwig are their parents - Raffey Cassidy as Denise does enough to get a namecheck for me.  And Don Cheadle looks very stylish as a professor of car crashes - or something.

As I previously said, it is very stylish and a lot of work has gone into making it look good - there's a sequence where Jack is searching through the rubbish and there's some incredible looking shots.  For a load of rubbish!  If only they'd put so much effort into the script, particularly plot-wise - the dialogue is a bit odd at times, but I can forgive it.  I can imagine that the original source may be hard to convert into a film (I've never read any DeLillo novels - but some serious US authors are impenetrable), but in that case just try and adapt something else.

Overall, I can't quite decide about this - I feel I should hate it, but it's more the case that I'm mildly intrigued as to why it happened.  Not enough to actually investigate the reason or anything, but if anyone knows feel free to tell me.  I'm certainly not going to recommend it to anyone - part of the point of me doing this is to save you from such films, so feel free to continue with your lives happy that you haven't wasted any time on this.  If you're desperate to ignore my wise advice then it's on Netflix - but don't say I didn't warn you...","Sep 25, 2023",Jason R,2

the_first_purge,"One of my favourite genres of films are those that look into dystopian worlds and futures. 

Recently I realised I'd never seen all of the films within 'The Purge' franchise, so with that in mind I decided to check into the bloody and unforgiving universe that these films live in.

In chronological order within the universe:

'The First Purge' (2018)
This film sets out how the Founding Fathers took control of America and their implementation of the first Purge in the small, impoverished, area of Staten Island. The true reasons behind The Purge are revealed here and it's a lot darker than we'd ever expect. This information serves us well for the rest of the franchise. (8/10)

'The Purge' (2013)
The original film feels a lot smaller in scale as it takes place within one household rather than a sprawling city scape. However, this is probably the best acted film within the franchise with Ethan Hawke putting in an exceptional performance. You'll probably never look at your neighbours the same way again after this. (8/10)

'The Purge: Anarchy' (2014)
Anarchy by name and it's anarchy by nature as Frank Grillo's character heads out for revenge on Purge night, but gets caught up in something more visceral. This film drives the franchise forward and sets up characters and scenarios that'll appear later in this universe. (7/10)

'The Purge: Election Year' (2016)
Grillo's character returns but this time as a secret service agent who's assigned the task of keeping a Presidential candidate alive during The Purge. The corruption of the Government is revealed as they change the rules of The Purge so they can remain in power. It's an intriguing look at how power corrupts absolutely. It's a bloody escapade of survival and redemption. (8/10)

'The Forever Purge' (2021)
This film shows America in complete chaos after 8 Purge free years, but with The Purge now returning after an election win for the Founding Fathers. As The Purge ends people rebel and act against immigrants and the rich. 'The Forever Purge' really highlights societal issues going on presently in America. The film's strengths really stand in its strong cast and a visceral rip-roarer of a story. It's a great way to end the franchise even though it appears we'll now get further films. (8/10)

Overall this is a great franchise which also spawned an Amazon Prime TV series. 

It's certainly a universe I'd like to see more of in the future. It's very raw in its vision, delivery and philosophy.

the_first_purge,"Mala película, por lejos me parece la peor de la saga. Tenia muchas expectativas con esta película ya que era una precuela y nos iba a contar el origen de la tan famosa purga y a mi parecer tenia potencial para mínimo estar a la altura de las anteriores, pero no fue el caso. Lo mejor de la película y de la saga en general sigue siendo la ambientación, es algo que me gusta mucho ver a la gente loca en las calles con mascaras, armas o con los ojos de colores en esta cinta. Algo que tengo que decir es que me decepciono como se creo la purga, ya que no hubo una especie de votación por parte de algunas personas para la creación de la misma, sino que el gobierno decidió hacerla por su propia cuenta. La trama es entretenida por momentos, a pesar de que comete el mismo error de la tercera, que se me hace larga por momentos gracias a que tiene escenas que a mi parecer están de mas y hacen que pierda ritmo. Un gran error son la gran cantidad de incoherencias o decisiones tontas que tiene la cinta, en las anteriores también pasaba esto pero en esta entrega esta a otro nivel creo yo. Los efectos visuales me gustaron, hay una leve mejora en cuanto a la anterior ya que aumentaron su presupuesto. Por otro lado, las actuaciones de Y'lan Noel, Joivan Wade, Lex Scott Davis, Rotimi Paul y Marisa Tomei me gustaron, cumplen con sus papeles. En conclusión, una mala película que siento que podría haber sido mucho mejor, ya que tiene varios errores argumentales y por momentos no entretiene del todo; sin embargo, si sos fan de la saga o ya te viste las anteriores esta no te la podes perder. La recomiendo.","Apr 27, 2023",Pedro G,2

I did not love Annabelle. My biggest issue with this movie is the fact that I felt no horror, I felt no danger, nothing like that at all. When you see a horror film you want to not just see the threat, the danger, the fear, but you want to feel it, the chills down your spine, there is nothing like that at all in this movie, it lacks the horror, not even the cliché jump scares were good, it was so bad as a horror movie. The camera movement was very annoying, just annoying. Acting I felt could've been better, there was no passion. In terms of story, it is mediocre, it get's interesting once you reach the halfway point of the movie but still some things honestly just bored me. The cult aspect of this movie, I really enjoyed, that got me hooked, but then it sought of just lost track down the road.

En mi opinión, esta cinta es muy entretenida de principio a fin, a pesar de que en su historia no se cuenten muchas cosas relevantes salvo en su media hora final. La historia es lo que mas falla en esta entrega, ya que creo que si hubieran contado lo que se cuenta en la segunda cinta hubiera sido todo mas entretenido y contando una historia con muchas mas ideas. No es una cinta de terror en mi opinión ya que no me dio miedo ya que la mayoría de sustos son screamers sin sentido que se ven venir a lo lejos; solo puedo destacar una escena de terror en toda la película. Por otro lado, las actuaciones no son del todo buenas y en el elenco principal se extraña a los Warren, realmente se nota su ausencia. El personaje de Annabelle no sale mucho en la cinta y no llega a impactar tanto como en su primera aparición, algo decepcionante. En conclusión, una buena película que no llega a ser la gran cosa, se queda en una cinta de terror típica del ultimo siglo, con sustos que se ven venir y con una historia simple y que no se esfuerza en contar algo interesante.

Freddie coming through the wall in the original was fantastic. It's been replaced by really awful and obvious cgi.
And finally,  someone please tell me why Freddie looks like a horribly burned Teenage Mutant Ninga Turtle.
Disappointing. Avoid at all costs.","Oct 3, 2023",Heather  S,0

nightmare_on_elm_street_2010,"All that gore would've been so much more enjoyable, if they'd kept the original origin story of Freddy. Yes, a child predator is the worst nightmare of every parent, but a serial killer of children that made a deal with the devil to keep going his killing spree in the afterlife just takes the cake and is even more of a nightmare tbh.
So, no matter how good the special effects and gore are, if the killer isn't believable, it's just not scary. And might I add, gore also doesn't replace good directing! 

I should clarify though that I have not seen the original, I just did my research. But I have the feeling that I don't have to watch the original to know that this reboot was a miserable attempt on trying make something better that was probably already perfect. 
With that said, I'm gonna try to find the original now.","Sep 2, 2023",MA k,2

nightmare_on_elm_street_2010,"A disjointed, exhausting, passionless, and painful attempt at remaking the original classic. It feels like the makers of this feature yearned to make a 'Friday the 13th' rather than this. The actors are practically sleepwalking through this film of dark and blurred colours as well as a brand-new design for good ol' Freddy Krueger being present. The brilliantly simple yet effective special effects of the original that really made you feel like you are in a nightmare are traded in for shameless CG makeovers that can't fool anybody with even the simplest understanding of computer technology. Wes Craven would be ashamed at this shallow attempt to grasp for people's nostalgia with a franchise that is on its last legs even without this misfire.","Aug 27, 2023",Teddy B,0

I mean were these writers trying to compete with Shakespeare because, if that was the case, they need to recognize their limitations in order to avoid looking like damn fools.  At any rate, because of this major gaff (and one glance at the end of the movie will amply demonstrate what I'm talking about), I was glad when it was over which distinguishes this one from the really good movies, because when the really good ones are over it leaves me wanting more.","Apr 1, 2024",diane S,3

It's one of those movies that leave you feeling consistently uncomfortable, almost to the point of wanting to turn it off - rather than just throwing in occasional jump scares. This degree of fear/discomfort is something I've only felt from one other horror movie. 

Half of me tries to seek out movies with this kind of quality scares, where the other half feels like it's too much.

Come atteso poi la pellicola si sposta più sull'horror, pur mantenendo la volontà di incutere timore quasi solamente con l'uso dell'ansia e della tensione, utilizzando pochi scary jumps.
Nonostante questo naturalmente viene meno l'elemento più originale e meglio eseguito che è quello dell'autopsia, ripreso per qualche istante nel finale con un risultato meno felice.

I expect to see subtle changes that grow more obvious and dangerous, like done in Autopsy Simulator but it was all just too sudden to feel creepy anymore.

the_autopsy_of_jane_doe,"An effectively creepy supernatural indie horror film that strikes a beautiful balance of subverting expectations and common haunting tropes, while using classic techniques to set up and produce well crafted scares. Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch give outstanding performances and really bring to life this character driven script and story, and the cinematography really highlight the great use of the single location. While there were a couple effects that were shoddy, and one particular death comes at a price of sensical logic, there are two aspects that make the horror work: A) not showing too much too soon and using clues and callbacks to indicate that something is there even when we don't see it; and B) where a more mainstream Hollywood horror film would have our characters doing detective work and research to figure out the lore so they can beat the curse in the end, this film tells a story where the answers as to what the evil is are answered, yet the ending-ending leaves the story open, unresolved, and therefore much more unsettling.","Jan 19, 2024",Alfred M,4

I can say it could also be used as a tool for your kids if you know what I mean lol. I want to explain typical big horror movies have a budget ranging from 50-200 million dollars and this film was created with 1.3 that is one million three hundred thousand dollars. I posted below directly from wiki. So for some viewers to state it is garbage I would just ignore those and maybe they are just trying to hurt the movie because they are the same people who blew a massive budget filming something like VAN HELSING with a 160 million budget and produce utter trash so sending the workers to give these false reviews is not unlikely. I mean this era is very odd they also stated THE GALLOWS was to scary and it was a boring snooze fest but hey they have another one coming so I guess someone must have money to lose LOL. Do not miss this one it will likely go down in history as one of the best indie low budget films ever made and I am hopeful we get more from this creator soon!

Now, I am not someone who cares for gore or jump scares as I do not scare easily and they can be pretty predictable. Nor do I think that those make a good movie. I am much more interested in something that is psychological. So some criticisms for this movie I believe are more a matter of preferences. The plot is very original, and very creepy. And I think it is symbolic as well. There is a lot of mystery to the monster that you never end up figuring out, so a lot is left up to interpretation. It is quieter and slower paced than a traditional horror movie but that only adds to the creepiness. One criticism I read was about them stopping instead of running. But these are teenagers that are in high school and college from families that are not affluent, so they do not have an endless budget. They also do not know much about this monster, so they cannot really predict when it comes. I think overall this is a very good horror film with a unique plot.","Mar 6, 2024",Jane D,4

This is one of those films where I went on YouTube afterwards to get different opinions analyzing it. It's rare to use adjectives like ""intelligent"" and ""thought-provoking"" when discussing a horror film, but this is thankfully not your average everyday slash-the-throats-of-blondes-in-bikinis horror film. In many ways it reminds me of the innocence of the first HALLOWEEN movie, including a musical score of which John Carpenter would be very proud. In other ways it reminds of THE WITCH in that mood and atmosphere prevail over guts and gore. The cast of unknowns is uniformly good, including Monroe in the title role, looking like a drugged Marcia Brady throughout. I think there's a lot going on under the surface here and is open to interpretation. This is a thinking person's horror film, and for that I am very grateful.

Made with a measly $2 million, the movie perfectly portrays the effects of grief on a broken family and the consequences of bottling up our emotions rather than addressing them. The titular Babadook, allegorically utilized in this film as grief itself, is one of the most frightening antagonists ever put to screen, its stress-inducing screen time tricking the viewer into feeling as horrified and hopeless as our two protagonists and just as relieved as they were when their nightmare had concluded.

What most horror movies get wrong, this movie gets absolutely right, and the director should teach a master class on how to make a motion picture of this genre. This is more frightening and certainly more disturbing than a hundred Freddy Kruegers and Jason Voorheeses and Michael Myerses put together. The key to this movie's success is that that villain isn't the star of the show here - the mom is. And Davis gives a spellbinding performance that joins Toni Collette in HEREDITARY as one of the great horror movie performances of modern times. Heck, maybe even one of the great movie performances of modern times. Period. She deserved awards recognition. This is proof positive that what is left largely unseen and left to the viewer's imagination is scarier than buckets of blood and gore. And it's propelled by the simple idea of a mother protecting her son. My only minor regret is that I wish it had a bit more of a messy ending.

the_babadook,"This film had a lot of potential to be a great movie- great acting, a scary enough antagonist, and an original storyline, but fell short when it came to execution. There were many plot holes, confusing scenes, and scenes that had nothing to do with moving the plot forward. In one scene, the main character is watching a romance movie. Missing her husband, she goes to her room to pleasure herself. This scene left me very confused. How did that affect the main characters in the long run? How did that drive the plot forward? In what way was that scene necessary? 
The scene where her husband returns is very confusing as well. Even though it was clearly the Babadook, it still was confusing nonetheless. 
There were many other unnecessarily confusing scenes in this movie, some of which should've been removed from the movie completely because it wouldn't have changed the storyline in any way. The ending was very bizarre. It would have been a lot more interesting if Samuel had actually killed his mother and he had to live with the neighbor instead of the mother being completely executed. All in all, this movie wasn't the worst horror movie I've ever seen, but it did not meet my expectations.","Feb 9, 2024",Shea B,2

If I have one nitpick about this movie it's that in my opinion some of the lines delivered during very intense scenes seemed a little too over the top making them feel a bit goofy and unfitting but I think that's more of a personal thing due to my sense of humour and honestly it balances out cause some of those lines send chills down my spine every time I hear them

insidious,"After watching the movie, 'Insidious' I was convinced they took the themes of astral projection, demons and dreams from the novel 'The Demon Revels', which came out some years earlier and told a much more believable and chilling story. 
I was further convinced they were 'inspired' more by 'The Demon Revels' when I learnt  a character in the last follow up to 'Insidious', 'The Red Door', was in a coma as is a character in 'The Demon Revels'.","Feb 16, 2024",Nick S,3

insidious,"""Insidious"" is a spine-chilling horror film that manages to breathe new life into the genre. Directed by James Wan, the mastermind behind ""Saw"" and ""The Conjuring,"" this supernatural thriller takes viewers on a terrifying journey into the unknown, leaving them gasping for breath and clutching their seats in anticipation.

What sets ""Insidious"" apart from other horror movies is its ability to seamlessly blend psychological terror with jump scares. Rather than relying solely on blood and gore, the film taps into our deepest fears, exploiting the vulnerability of the human psyche. It's the subtle creaks, distant whispers, and flickering shadows that leave a lasting impression, haunting viewers long after the credits roll.

The film's visual aesthetics deserve special mention. From the dimly lit corridors to the eerie attic, every frame is meticulously crafted to create an atmosphere of dread and apprehension. The sinister red and black color palette further accentuates the impending danger lurking around every corner. Wan's expertise in building tension is on full display here, as he masterfully employs long, lingering shots to heighten the audience's sense of unease.

In conclusion, ""Insidious"" is a well-crafted and genuinely terrifying horror movie that transcends the conventional tropes of the genre. James Wan's masterful direction, coupled with a talented cast, creates an intense and suspenseful experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat. If you're in the mood for a heart-pounding journey into the realm of the supernatural, ""Insidious"" is a must-watch. Just make sure to leave the lights on afterwards.","Nov 11, 2023",matthias s,4

Bill Denbrough, leading ""The Losers"" group, is determined to confront Pennywise and avenge his brother's death. However, I wouldn't recommend this movie because it's too predictable, lacks genuine scares, and the ending is exactly what you'd expect.

I watch lots of movies  and i'm picky and get bored easily. This move has genuinely been be favorite movie ( and i mean #1), since it first came out. I watched it ( get it? ) in theatre and from then on i was obsessed. I'm in love with this movie and probably watched it many more than ten times.  This movie is pretty spooky, especially with the visuals, and the characters are great, all with their own personalities, and this movie will definitely keep you entertained full every second. Watching all the characters experienced with IT, and watching them be brought together by this trauma and being seen as an outsider is amazing to watch. These actors all have such amazing skill. What makes me love this movie even more is its comedic relief or even just subtle humor.  In many scenes I would notice characters reactions that would make me laugh, especially in the background of scary scenes. It isn't a bad laugh like an "" oh this isn't scary "" but just finding the humor in this group of kids, being kids, What makes me enjoy it so much is the theme of kids going through such horrible trauma that it kind of makes them have to act or be older, where they should be playing and having fun with no worries, they have to deal with such a terrible and monstrous creature that is nothing but risk and  danger. The jokes these kids make in the movie are actually funny. The chemistry between characters are very visible. The summer vibes of the 1989 is so appealing and addicting. The  theme of kids being forced to grow up by a traumatizing experience is what i look for in many movies, especially horror. I tend to fall in love with those type of movies, they are for sure my preference. Also if you watch this movie, you HAVE to watch the second one to it, where it adds more scene referring to their childhood. Though they are all adults who have forgotten about a lot, it's still super good. Anyways, i highly recommend this movie, as i completely love IT.","Feb 11, 2024",Loser B,5

nightmare_on_elm_street,"""Nightmare on Elm Street"" delivers a terrifying thrill that keeps you on the edge. Freddy Krueger's burnt visage and wicked humor make him an iconic horror figure. The film's ingenious concept of a killer invading dreams blurs reality and nightmare seamlessly. Every suspenseful moment, from a flickering streetlight to a creepy nursery rhyme, sinks its hooks into your psyche.

The movie's power lies in its ability to warp innocent sleep into a realm of dread. Brace yourself for heart-pounding scares and adrenaline-fueled gasps as the line between dreams and reality dissolves. Don't be surprised if you find yourself double-checking your room before bedtime.

I also remember leaving the cinema around 50 minutes later after Paul Anderson virtually pissed into my popcorn while constantly farting in my face. At least thats how I felt afterwards. He didn't butcher it, that would be an insult to every butcher alive. It was simply not what was written on the tin.

One such theme is the idea of a powerful and secretive corporation (Umbrella Corporation in the film) conducting unethical experiments and creating a deadly virus that leads to a global epidemic. 
This theme echoes conspiracy theories that suggest real-world organizations or governments may be involved in clandestine operations, secret experiments, or the manipulation of events that could lead to catastrophic outcomes.

Additionally, the ""Resident Evil"" films explore the concept of a government cover-up and the suppression of information about the true nature of the epidemic. Conspiracy theories often revolve around the idea that authorities are hiding the truth from the public, whether it's about the origins of a disease, the effectiveness of treatments, or the existence of a cure.

The only slight issue is sometimes it can be a bit unclear when it's somewhere in the middle but it's so interesting, witty, smart, and original an idea that you stay with it. Another big reason for that is because everything about this is pretty solid all around. Heather is good in this and Freddy is actually initimidating and a return to form. All the returning cast playing themselves is really good also except for Dillon who is just ok and probably the weakest thing in this. The other issue is a lot of the first half can move at a slow rate and while the scenes are smart there isn't much visually that pops in them and the settings aren't that memorable. This isn't really scary for most of it's runtime until the end when Freddy truly shows up (he's not in this for most of the runtime) and is more suspensful in a slow burn type of way. Once Julie is killed it really picks itself up and delivers a solid ending. The meta style here is really well done also. Anyone who is a fan of the franchise or any actors in this should watch it. My personal opinion watch the first, the third, and this. With just those 3 it's one of the best horror movie sequences ever made.","Nov 16, 2023",Blu B,4

wes_cravens_new_nightmare,"Not without some intelligence, Wes Craven dips his toe into the post-modern horror genre. However, despite this smart meta-theme, and excellent performances from the likes of Heather Langenkamp, this film run out of gas especially in the second and third acts. There is also too much reliance on the child actor and some of the worst CGI of all time. Also, the new freddie makeup is much worse than the original.","Oct 16, 2023",Night T,3

wes_cravens_new_nightmare,"Wes Craven was, of course, one of the luminaries of horror cinema. From his portfolio, such works as the Scream franchise are definitely worth highlighting. Or the horror Teleb Street movie series. The main key to the successful career of this director is the eclecticism of horror and comedy elements. In his horror films, we often come across funny and entertaining scenes. It is because of this paradoxical style that the audience fell in love with this person. But which movie is the best? This question is a bit rhetorical. Because almost all of Craveney's works have their own charm. But I would choose Wes Craven's The New Nightmare. This movie is the 7th and final installment in the horror franchise of Calf Street. After 1994, this legendary film saga came to an end. (A remake of the first film was released in 2010, but it was a box office failure) Why does this film stand out and how is it different from other horror films? Better with creativity and non-standard concept. The main characters are actual actors from previous films in the franchise. The role of Robert Englund is played by Robert Englund, Heather Langenkamp is played by Heather herself. The synopsis of the movie is very strange. Freddy Krueger descends into the real world to destroy Heather Langenkamp and her family. Both in child's play and in this film, I played the role of mother. Heather Langenkamp loves her son Dylan like Schleg. In this case, the mother is the child's protective shield. She represents a woman who has several good qualities. 1) He is ready to sacrifice himself for his loved ones. 2) She thinks quickly, that is, she fits the role of Nancy convincingly even in real life. 80's horror movie stars were not appreciated in the movie business. That's why Heather Langenkamp couldn't become a famous actress and ended up behind the mainstream radar. Like Child's play, the favorite scene in this movie is the fight between the two main characters (positive and negative). Langenkamp and Freddy. (When Heather is interviewed by the King of Dreams in her room) The ending of the film is very humane, because after Freddie's death, the mother reads the script written by Wes Craven with her boyfriend, the very script that copied the concept of cinema into the real world. In short, the 7th film is the best series in the entire franchise. I think that after 1994, citizens living on Teleb Street are sleeping peacefully","Aug 29, 2023",kotiko  g,4

wes_cravens_new_nightmare,"Wes Craven's New Nightmare is a clever and meta sequel that reinvents the franchise and pays homage to its origins. The film blurs the line between reality and fiction, as it features the actors and filmmakers of the original film playing themselves, who are stalked by a darker and more sinister version of Freddy Krueger. The film focuses on Heather Langenkamp, who played Nancy Thompson in the first and third films, as she struggles with nightmares, stalkers, earthquakes, and her son's strange behavior. She learns that Wes Craven is writing a new script based on his own dreams, and that Freddy is a demonic force that can only be contained by stories. She must reprise her role as Nancy and face Freddy one last time to save her family and the world. The film is a smart and scary commentary on the power of horror and storytelling, as well as a tribute to the fans and the legacy of Freddy Krueger. The film also features some of the best acting, directing, writing, and special effects in the series, as well as a chilling performance by Robert Englund as both himself and Freddy.","Apr 23, 2023",SF P,4

However, they show one of them die a horrific death. Because of the cuts, you expect someone to come and save her but no one does. And that was really well done. It's just very very shocking since the movie almost fell like a kids movie (not including the first scene) with heavy plot armor.

rebel_moon_part_1_a_child_of_fire,"Rebel moon has rich visual storytelling. The opening scene with the narrative of an empirical world who destroyed their planet and the tragedy that forced the loss of their Monarchy, teasing treachery, and political intrigue and strife while introducing an indomitably cruel and sadistic minor antagonist who is but a pawn for the final Villain antagonist directing things from the shadows is an ominous launching point for the story.  

The protragonist, Kora, later to be revealed to be a girl in hiding by another name has an intricately complicated relationship with the final Villain antagonist which only strengthens the plot surrounding her journey to gather individuals to her cause that could defeat this indomitable foe.

Her journey however, begins on a planet as a simple farmer, but we soon learn what she is and her intricate background soon reveals itself in narrative and action as well as her knowledge of how to deal with the newcomers to the planet Veldt, which to the imminent peril of the inhabitants of Veldt is largely ignored. 

The history of the story at times is spoken in narratives to move the story along, but this seems to be due to the time limits placed on the story, which sits roughly at 2 hours and 16 minutes. It could have been an 8 hour show, filling with  expansive descriptive storytelling about the people, the universe and the cultures.

The actual narratives accompanied by flashbacks are rich with historical significance and recognizable symbolism, and has all the action packed nuance of previous Zack Snyder works with well choreographed fight scenes that move the story in references to previous scenes, and expansion of the influence of powers in the universe. These action scenes also offer supplemental knowledge to the dialogue revealing strengths, weaknesses and experience of characters that help you understand who they are, where they came from and why they are there. 

This first installment is an incredible introduction into a rich and vibrant universe that has the potential to become more than just the story that's told, and I look forward to future installments that continue to create a more vibrant painting of a universe, it's politics and it's people who live within it.

With incredible performances by Sofia Boutella (Star Trek: Beyond, The Kingsman: the Secret Service) , Djimon Hounsou (Gladiator, Guardians of the Galaxy, A Quiet Place  part II), Ray Fisher (Justice League, The piano Lesson) , Anthony Hopkins (The Silence of the Lambs, The Father, One Life, The Mask of Zorro) and many more.","Apr 3, 2024",Rob J,3

mortal_engines,"I think this would have worked if it has been a TV ""Series"". There are some decent CGI, but overall it has a look of a mid- TV budget show. 

I can see the initial problem is the cuts and acting direction. From what I observed from many different films, even with not so good actors, a good director or editor can make actors look good or... give them the facial expressions they need to make less ""cringey"" or campy acting. It does feel like they shot it as first take instead making them work the scene. The facial expressions are too close to the scene and if that's what the audience sees then that's what they will complain about.","Feb 25, 2024",Marvin S,3

This mildly-dystopian sci-fi has social class and the disparity of wealth at its core, even though the characters lack of depth mean that any real sense of oppression is thinly veiled, often making it hard to know what or who they are all fighting.

the_kitchen_2023,"I think this would make a fabulous modern 1984 for young people to study in schools. It's ambivalent people have said,  I disagree. It's all about the modern world and the wealth divide / cost of living crisis that has carried on getting MUCH worse, leaving people living in bare bones accommodation they've co-created themselves called The Kitchen. The authorities are trying to shut it down and evict everyone from illegally living in this large community building. There is a young boy, Benji, who's faced with making some tough decisions about who to trust in this place after his mum passes away. There's Izzi, who somehow knew Benji's mum who also lives at the Kitchen and is due to secure an upgraded nice legitimate flat. There is a gang in the area of younger people who seem to respect each other and have shared space together too who also decide when to give retribution for their socio-economic situation.  Benji is unsure if he is being foolish or actually making effective alliances.  

Long story short,  the acting is incredible,  the feel is gritty and real, the whole film for me is about the decisions each is faced with and what survival and thriving are for them,  two different things entirely.  There is also the question of how much a hard life can deprive you of your ethics, or not.  I took a great deal out of this,  haven't stopped thinking about it.","Feb 10, 2024",Shauna T R N,4

the_stranger_2022,"An interminable film,  I watched to this to the very end, but only because I'd already invested too many precious minutes in it (sunk-cost fallacy). 
This is a prime example of a film without an assertive producer: someone who could discipline the director and prevent him allowing what should have been a gripping story from degenerating into a turgid mess. A pity, because 
there are some talented performances, striking cinematography and a good atmospheric score. It reminded me of The Irishman- another film that also appeared to lack a decent producer.
As with Scorsese, someone needed to tell this director to can the boring scenes: long ones when the two main characters sit beside each other in a succession of cars; dull tracking shots of Australian roads: and frequent non-sequiturs that break the narrative flow.

We know that the authorities are working on an elaborate scheme to trick him into a confession, but we don't know much about the suspect's personality, his motivations, the details and circumstances of the abduction or who the victim was. We're not even sure whether a seemingly nice guy is really a criminal. So we watch the story with little emotional involvement until very late when most doubts are cleared.

The rest of the other cast I don't care 😁 i'm just here for Pedro and Oscar.

triple_frontier,"A solid cast and gorgeous setting isn't enough to save this fundamentally flawed storyline that flirts with the value of mercenary action. Despite its own flaws, at least a movie like Uncommon Valor has its heart in the right place (saving POWs in Laos), while this story--with Oscar Issac's moral ambivalence at the center of it all--tries to have it both ways: saying to hell with ""the system"" while praising it all the same. In the end it comes across as odd given his decisions cost them everything, yet he walks away a free (and even respected) man. And we're supposed to think that donating all the money to Redfly's (played by Ben Affleck) trust makes up for it?

godzilla_2014,"I saw this in the theaters and enjoyed it.  I was like some people where it sucked not seeing Godzilla till an hr into the movie.  I know that is what the director (Edwards) was trying to do by billing up the suspense.  But this was the most realistic movie so far in the franchise.  I have been a Godzilla fan since I was a kid.  But since the 1998 Godzilla, it would be hard to realize if there would ever be a realistic/good Godzilla movie, until this movie.  The SFX is superb and the story was ok, but it would have been better if Byrant Craynston's character had been in the whole movie, giving that crazy grieving character more emotion and heart in the movie than his son.","Apr 1, 2024",Ryan N,3

damsel_2023,"A disappointment.

'Damsel' has the right ingredients but unfortunately fails to deliver. Millie Bobby Brown leads the cast in alright fashion, her performance in the lead role is serviceable. She is probably the only positive that I hold for this 2024 film sadly.

My main negative is the special effects, which are quite distracting throughout - barely any of it comes across as convincing. The dragon looks OK, but the way it moved sometimes didn't seem right. Speaking of that creature, Shohreh Aghdashloo is a neat piece of casting on paper, though her voice was not the most fitting in actuality. The lighting also felt odd.

On the cast, away from Brown, Robin Wright is very meh in her role, while Angela Bassett feels extremely wasted. There is, at least, a nice end credits song from the ace Lykke Li, ""Ring of Fire"" is admittedly incomparable to ""No Rest for the Wicked"" but it is pretty good all the same!","Apr 6, 2024",r96 s,2
damsel_2023,"Its fine - thats it. If youre teenager or younger you might find it entertaining and enjoyable. Personally it bothered me that story was so cringe and boring. The dragon could look better in my opinion. Its movie about dragon - I want to see dragon. Acting of the main character was good, She is good actress, but others disappointed me. The scenes are so boring, I could not connect with characters or with what was happening. 

⚠️ spoiler warning 

The scene with her coming back and crashing the wedding and conversation she had, the whole speech - it was cringe fest.

The movie does get some cameos which is great, but their roles do not align correctly with the Ghostbusters franchise either.
If you like Saturday Night Live, their cast, or into comedy, then you will probably like this movie; however, if you're a die hard Ghostbusters fan, you will probably hate the movie.  
The movie is similar to many of the movies out their that kind of pokes fun at the original movie.  My family and I did enjoy the movie, we thought it was funny.

The moment the reboot was announced with Paul Feige I was willing to give it a go as he was the genius behind The Heat, Bridesmaids and Spy all which I loved and MC Carthy back after Spy I felt this was gonna be really good, the trailer came out suggested that it was set after the original films and the opening sequence was actually kinda creepy and started strong.
Much like the 84 original we are introduced to the team and thou there were a few laughs here and there we got to the first ghost at the rock concert. My problem with this part of the film I was hoping for world building, you know the fact they are carrying unlicensed nuclear accelerators on their backs, a moment to fuck up and correct themselves. You know real stuff that real people go through, but nope these gals move through with perfection. Huge ghost at a rock concert, surly they will evacuated the people so they can catch it 🤷🏽‍♂️ nope not here. Nothing in this scene made a lick of sense and played up the let's go with it it's a comedy for laughs thing. Problem is your world building ha e fun sure but don't belittled the audience or your own movie.
The film went on and every single make character was either Dumb, incompetent or just a dick. 
I know it's female Ghostbusters but majority of your audience are guys 🤦🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
I digress, then comes the cameos pointless cameos that didn't add to the film just distract as they were not playing their old characters and cementing that it was just a reboot period.
The finally sucked in a huge CGI gun battle across NYC and the whole film like most dumpster Sony Studio pics smelt of rotten eggs.

ghostbusters_2016,"In all honesty, this is an average movie.
Neither the best nor the worst.
Some of the comedy worked, some didn't
Most of the practical effects were as cool as I remembered them even back in the previous two movies along with the new gadgets that were pretty badass that even elevates the ghostbusting scenes.
Everyone did perform well as they were having fun, especially Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig.
Except for Chris Hemsworth, sadly.
I think this movie gets too much hate since it was released and still does from both sides.
But let me be one-hundred percent honest, it's such a headache to take sides.
If you love this film, that's fine
If you hate this film, that's your opinion.
All in all, I still had fun even by some of the comedy that doesn't work well especially with how the story leads into.
And the cameos, however, don't feel that good as it's an example of a cameo done wrong.
Actually, if anything sums it up, this movie is like how one of the Futurama episodes involving boxes and alternate dimensions, being an alternative dimension.

ghostbusters_2016,"It's okay. I really wanted to like this reboot, but it's just flat. I hate to say it, but the only actor who shines in this female-driven cast is the man. Chris Hemsworth plays the typical dimwitted but good looking muscle. Almost as dumb as season 10 Joey from Friends (that Joey Can't Speak French episode makes me cringe every time) which at first I found annoying but really setup his transition to the SPOILER ALERT: bad guy in the final act, which doesn't get the opportunity to work because the film dissolves into a washed out CGI extravaganza.

The main four start out likeable, but fall into their archetypes pretty fast:
-Melissa McCarthy, who for the record is a fantastic actress with potential, playing the (as the late Chris Farley once put it) ""fatty fall down"" role as she often did in the 2010s if that's not too harsh to say in 2024
-Kate McKinnon plays the rebel
-Kristen Wiig plays Kristen Wiig
-Leslie Jones plays the blue collar worker

Each one by themself is an alright character who I could buy would be part of the Ghostbusters team, but together none of them have any real chemistry as it feels like there was no script and they're all just comedians riffing with each other.

Despite some good visual design work, including ghosts who do look like they would belong in the original film, I would not recommend this movie. In my opinion, reboots should either be a modern, but faithful retelling of the original OR should be radically different and try to stand out from what came before it. This film has a hand in each cookie jar and suffers for it.","Mar 3, 2024",Kurtis E,2
ghostbusters_2016,"Using a female cast to change from the past all-male cast is an idea we've already seen and isn't always something bad. Making them look good is logical (you always want your main characters to look good after all !) But this, this is just too much. Every single male is a moron who doesn't understand anything and can't add two and two to make four, and I mean, EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. All female characters are pictured as strong and independent characters that are extremely clever and I have no problem with that. However, they are always mocking men and men don't react, because they are even too stupid to understand what's going on ! I guess the idea here was to make a change from the original movies, where the main cast was all-male, and the woman needed to be saved. Of course, the way women are depicted in these movies may seem old-fashioned and even offensive to some people, but it is absolutely not a reason to reply several decades later with an even worse movie : it seems like an immature movie to me.
Of course, the special effects are way better than the two past movies, that I can't deny, but however good a movie looks, the idea behind still wastes everything.
Therefore, I think this movie is quite enjoyable if you only watch the movie for its special effects and to pass time. If you are looking for a good storyline or good characters, just look somewhere else : you will lose your time here.","Feb 24, 2024",Karl O,0

It feels like the scriptwriters have outdone themselves with clever finds to create a ‘mission impossible' style movie full of technical gadgetry and plot turns, but like actor Freddie Higmore remarks: sometimes you need to think simple. More is not always better. 
At the start, the sound and filming is gripping. Further into the movie, if you're willing to overlook a huge amount of improbabilities in the setup, you're well enough entertained. But * spoiler alert * it is a bit much too ask of an audience that, even during a world cup football match, not one guard or policeman, forewarned, would notice three black-clad figures walking over white roofs… or that two of them, well captured on security camera, would be able to escape from Spain to France and not found by Europol.. also their own team follows them on scanners during the heist, but the sophisticated surveillance systems of the bank do not pick up the signals… nop, a slightly technical-savvy viewer will be slightly annoyed…

Its also well-acted and has solid visual effects, except for one shot in the end. However, it ends in a way that feels incomplete in regards to character arcs as its ending is neither hopeful nor bleak. Taking into account the current impending conflicts between America and Russia, it could have provided some sense of commentary on the matter. Instead, it remains apolitical to the point where the movie just aims to be brief escapism for you. If thats your taste, then please see it.

geostorm,"This movie was so bad it was good! Well, actually, it never got good. But I paid attention. Well, I barely paid attention. But somehow I still completely followed along. Several problematic suppositions within the film:

1. That's not what a geostorm is. 
2. In the future (or the present? everything was very of the now except for their EXTREMELY fancy cell phones), will all digital interfaces make a bunch of beep-boop sounds every time they process information?
3. Everything extreme weather touches immediately bursts into flames.
4. Instant ice age!
5. At some point it stopped being about weather and just became giant lasers shooting out of the sky and blowing things up. That was a twist!

There actually are no plot twists except for the sudden appearance of giant lasers. There is NOTHING about this movie that will surprise you. Everything is COMPLETELY predictable. Including the fact that it ends on an abundantly happy note -- even a random Indian kid who is not an actual character in the film gets his dog back! -- despite the fact that hundreds of thousands of people have just been killed in a day, and entire cities were toppled, in a plot carried out by, I think, three people.

geostorm,"As yet another world ending disaster film in the already long list, Geostorm brought an interesting premise to make it stand out. Having a human created 'natural' disaster machine adds an interesting element to the film, but when you have boring and annoying characters behind it all, it works against you instead of for you. With a pretty standard script for the genre, the journey to the end feels long and drawn out as you bounce between characters that don't feel like they care to be there. The visuals are all incredible, but they fail to bring us anything we haven't already seen in much better films. Drowning in an oversaturated and unoriginal genre, Geostorm failed to bring anything new or exciting to this table, which leads to it being forgotten amongst all the rest.","Nov 27, 2023",Lou T,2

captain_marvel,"This film has a sense of awesomeness. The character of Carol Danvers is iconic. The story is great, it has a philosophical undertone about the meaning of life, Carol impersonating light itself. One scene reminded me of Gattaca, one of my favorites films ever. Nick Fury also shines, as do Maria Rambeau.
The weakest point for me is the lack of distinctive environment that I will remember, except the house of Maria and Monica Rambeau in Louisiana and the military airport. However, it has some memorable scenes and the general aesthetics is great, with an omnipresent 90's nostalgia.
I have an emotional attachment to this story and its characters since the first time I saw it. I love Carol Danvers, I love the Rambeau family, I love Goose. I loved The Marvels and Kamala Khan's character as well. I really hope we get a last film to close the trilogy.","Dec 16, 2023",Lonny C,4

Carol being out in space and Fury never calling his ""backup Superman"" until he did was contrived and stupid. Nothing about the MCU's use of this character is good or interesting.

I recently had the opportunity to watch the film ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,"" and I must say, it was quite the thrilling adventure! With an intriguing storyline and captivating characters, this movie definitely deserves a solid 8 out of 10 rating from me.

One of the aspects that truly impressed me about this film was the incredible attention to detail in the visuals. The stunning cinematography and breathtaking special effects brought the pirate world to life in a way that was both visually stunning and immersive. From the epic sea battles to the eerie ghostly encounters, every scene was a visual treat.

But it wasn't just the visuals that made this film stand out. The performances of the cast were also top-notch. Johnny Depp reprised his iconic role as Captain Jack Sparrow with his trademark wit and charm, delivering a performance that was both hilarious and endearing. Javier Bardem's portrayal of Captain Salazar was equally impressive, bringing a menacing presence to the screen that sent shivers down my spine.

The storyline itself was filled with twists and turns, keeping me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. The quest for the Trident of Poseidon was not only a race against time but also a journey of self-discovery for both Jack Sparrow and Henry Turner. Their personal growth and development added depth to the story, making it more than just a typical pirate adventure.

Another aspect that I appreciated about this film was the well-balanced mix of action and humor. The action sequences were intense and exhilarating, with sword fights, ship battles, and daring escapes that had my heart racing. At the same time, the humor injected into the film provided much-needed comic relief, lightening the mood and adding an extra layer of enjoyment.

Overall, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales"" is a fantastic addition to the franchise. It successfully captures the spirit of the original films while introducing new elements that keep the story fresh and exciting. With its stunning visuals, captivating performances, and thrilling storyline, this film is a must-watch for any fan of the series.

While it may not be a perfect 10, I believe it deserves a solid 8 out of 10 rating. It's an entertaining and enjoyable experience that will leave you wanting more. So grab your popcorn, sit back, and prepare to set sail on an unforgettable adventure with Captain Jack Sparrow and his crew!","Jul 24, 2023",Carl J,4

I feel like there are people that will get a kick and have fun with this movie as it does have action but this movie doesn't do anything to enhance the action or the story that feels even more generic and unoriginal.

On the plus side; the suspense and tension was palpable. Gerard Butler did a good job building empathy for his character and getting you to pull hard for him to find his wife. 

So, why 3.5 stars?. Now I have to admit my bias. I am a big Gerard Butler fan. No, he isn't a great actor. But he is the best at that stereotypical role he's asked to play.. the average 'Joe' who is required to perform above average acts.

A fare la differenza in positivo è senza dubbio il lungo piano sequenza che porta il protagonista Gerald Butler (macchina perfetta per i film d'azione) alla ricerca della moglie nel campo in cui è detenuta.
Questo piano sequenza permette allo spettatore di immedesimarsi alla perfezione nel protagonista e nella sua esplorazione del territorio nemico, senza grandi azioni da Navy Seals; cosa che lo rende più vicino alla credibilità.

The Intro and Ending fall a bit flat, it's clear that they took some shortcuts there. Most of the time travel movies seem to have the problem that either the character has way much implied information regarding what happens when or that they just completely ignore usages for their time travel, this is something that this movie really excels at, the character is very aware of what should and shouldn't be done and acted very human. That is why I can overlook many of the movies flaws and can really recommend the movie!","Feb 21, 2024",Maximilian S,4

Trying so hard to look slick, yes it looked like very slick and well produced garbage.  The action tried so hard to be over the top and cool, it forgot to be believable and interesting.

Even though I did enjoys this film, I couldn't rate it any higher as in my opinion it doesn't compare to other spy films like James Bond and Mission Impossible. However it is is a very empowering film for women as we see Rachel (Gal Gadot) being one of the best spies in this films universe and Alia Bhatt's character (Keya) being a tech genius that can't be out brained by the leading man.

The film has exciting action sequences with a nice side element of comedy which keeps the film cheerful and fun. I really did enjoy the twist and the extent of the twist did shocked me. 

The film has a heartwarming and satisfying ending and makes you reminisce the characters we have lost.","Nov 14, 2023",Maybe M,3

The characters lack of compassion for “parents “of 24 years.seemed out of touch and over the top cold . The female lead character was written overtly cold and again not realistic of someone who might find themselves in that position in real life.Wasn’t fond of the character of Dawson or the way it was written either, I could honor about ten way he was written but will stop.

a_fragile_flower,"t's somewhat challenging to articulate precisely why this fails so spectacularly, not due to a scarcity of issues, but rather the overwhelming abundance of them.

The piece seems to attempt a fusion between the essence of a karaoke performer and the narrative depth of ""Her Life,"" yet the outcome is disastrously disheartening. The musical elements are particularly excruciating. The core of the issue lies in the film's inability to foster any connection with its characters, marred by inept scripting and storytelling. Additionally, the actions and motivations of the supposed ""cast"" defy any logical explanation throughout. The film's overall mood is baffling – one might wonder, is there an attempt at humor? Is there an underlying message or theme? Could it be classified as a drama?

They all look young, but most of them are like, way over 60, and a few are in their 50s. This movie is totally for old people. And you know what? Like all old people stuff, it's super slow and hard to get. I just don't get old Vietnamese people. They're just so different, you know?

This disconnect made it hard for us to relate to the movie. Additionally, the Music was a letdown I couldn't help but wonder why Thuy Nga wasn't involved in the project.

It's painfully worse than the warblings of a karaoke night gone wrong. Sitting through this movie is akin to throwing away $20 and two precious hours of your life, which you will never get back. It's as if someone took an amateur film project, devoid of skill or artistry, and somehow managed to get it on the big screen.

Of course sex and sensationalism sells, it's the easy way to garner attention. My husband, who never watches a movie all the way through, wants to rewatch this with his glasses on.

glitter_and_doom,"Let yourself get sucked into this universe about two very honest characters grappling with things we know too well, like fear of failure, insecurity and how much to let people in. 
Their sincerity is crisp amidst a colorful, musical, sometimes surreal world of dancers and musicians in gorgeous costumes. 
There are layers of special effects that you should not try to compare with Hollywood CGI. 

This is a movie made from the heart that will warm your heart and make you feel less alone.

It show true emotion it was confusing, but you honestly got the deep down part of how teenagers feel on a daily basics teenage love two orphans finally learn to love. Learned true. Meaning of the love when you're in love you can feel hurt pain. Happiness is all these emotions combine especially if you like poetry. This is great and the movie its wolf AK rider, he falls in love with his tearsmith the girl he desperately wants to be with, but he can't be with, but he doesn't care because he's in love, so no matter what happened and what he knows he'll get in trouble for he's not supposed to be with her is a crazy thing so he still gets with her and at the end of the day the good things always have a bad part in it","Apr 7, 2024",Nia,5

the_tearsmith,"3/5. I was expecting a lot from this movie mostly because of the plot but also because of the characters. It kinda disapointed me since throughout the movie i felt the scenes being rushed and often cringy. Don't get me wrong, the main characters did an amazing job at acting but it just felt like a Wattpad fanfiction. The producers made Rigel seem like a cold and horny teenager, when he had so much more to show us. The cinematography was really good, and the piano made it 100 times better. Personally, my favorite scene is when Nica and Rigel embraced together in a passionate kiss at the mid-end to the movie. Their chemestry was undeniable. I will be watching this movie again just for Simone (Rigel), he is a real cup of tea.","Apr 6, 2024",Madalena B,3

Pela ambientação dá a entender que seria um romance sombrio, mas é tão blasé que chega a ser tosco. Para finalizar, esse filtro azulado aplicado em diversos momentos me dá a sensação de estar assistindo um filme sobre personagens secundários de Crepúsculo.
Honestamente, me senti assistindo a adaptação de fanfics escritas por adolescentes de 13 anos no Spirit em 2013, valeu a nostalgia pelo menos, se a gente levar na comédia fica até engraçado, mas se for levar o filme a sério... Bem, assista e vai entender o que estou falando.","Apr 6, 2024",Ana m,1

I personally like the actors and the structure of the story. Lots of drama, but not over the top. I can only repeat: you never know what will happen next.

On the other hand the movie is so much fun and joy, but sometimes they went a little too far with the jokes. The film tries to build on the beauty of the whole cast, but I think that was a mistake. Every person in this film has no real problem. They look beautiful, they have people to love and they have money. Even though the movie tells you that Bea (Sydney Sweeney) has problems with her life, it does not seem real, because she can do whatever she wants.

Forse ci si sofferma un po' troppo su una parte intermedia in cui il personaggio di Sturgess diventa leggermente ripetitivo e meno interessante.
Finale molto delicato, specie nella conversazione tra i due personaggi maschili.

Was definitely a journey and a half but the tone of the story and the depth of life which happens in between a romantic relationship was depicted so accurately and raw.

the_oath_2023,"I want to tell you about my reaction to the movie. I'm embarrassed to say I wasn't expecting it to be as polished or professional as a typical Hollywood blockbuster. This week is not only the Christmas-New Year week, it is also my birthday (December 26) and my wife's birthday (today, December 29). So, I took the day of work to celebrate. Last night Minda & I went to see ""Boys in the Boat"" and found it to be a wonderful movie, though very formulaic. I'd enthusiastically recommend it to anyone—expecially to families or other groups who want to learn to achieve greater success by working harmoniously and seamlessly. But, like I said, we chose to go see The Oath not because we expected to see a great film, but more because we like to support ""Mormon art"", excuse the expression.

Boy was I wrong.

There is nothing formulaic about The Oath and yet it presents a coherent, powerful, and beautifully told story. It is obvious that anyone who could have written the screenplay and directed this movie knows The Book of Mormon very well, loves The Book of Mormon, and has a fervent conviction of the veracity of that ancient work. Since I first read The Book of Mormon at age 15 (and at least once a year on the average since that time (I'm now 71) I've often pondered what life might have been like for Moroni after his father and all his kinsfolk had died (or deserted to join the Lamanites). Surely Moroni was hunted and no doubt had a price on his head. Anyone who's read Moroni's account realizes he was noble, bold, physically fit, of a keen intellect, and had a tender heart. Your movie portrays Moroni masterfully. It also posits a truly plausible tale of what Moroni's later life might have been like.The story moves along quickly and though it has all the compelling elements of a top-notch action movie it is more believable than any action movie I've ever seen. I wouldn't be surprised if your tale turns out to be what actually happened to Moroni. Maybe. Maybe not. But if nothing else, it is definitely a very realistic and believable touchstone of Latter-day Saint culture.

You were wonderfully imaginative in deciding to make this movie. I'm sure you (and others) prayed diligently for inspiration and guidance once you determined to go ahead and actually embark on the work. Your prayers were heard. I am often a critic of what I call an ""ego-trip movies"" where the main star is also the writer and director. Such movies are almost always dismal failures...hokie to the extreme. Take WaterWorld and Yentl, for example. I don't see any ego getting in the way of The Oath, however. I think only a bold, creative, and humble soul could have had the vision and drive to accomplish such a magnificent work as your film, The Oath. You were exactly the right age and had the right physique and the right look as well as the right mannerisms to pull off your portrayal of Moroni. Your background (such as your role in Ephraim's Rescue) and working with top professionals obviously helped you prepare and helped you get the connections needed to be successful.

When the man (I forgot his name) who gave Handel the Bible verses that formed the libreto for Handel's ""Messiah"" witnessed the completed production, he told George Frederick Handel that he ""made very good entertainment out of it"". Handel responded that he'd be very disappointed ""if I only entertained them. I intended to make them better."" Congratulations on making a film that makes us want to be better—while entertaining us profoundly. Congratulations on a gargantuan work of art so well done!","Feb 5, 2024",Daniel L,5

Marriage was portrayed as a cheap thing that anyone can do just by speaking words to each other. Disappointed. Why does this whole thing now remind me of “the emperor’s new clothes?” It seems like nobody close to Darin wants to be brave and tell him the truth about this film. It seems like everyone is afraid to criticize it because the perceived wisdom is that just because Darin is a good guy, no one should offer any rebuttal.","Jan 23, 2024",Reviewer not found,0

the_oath_2023,"This is clearly a historical fiction. Of course this takes some creative liberty with the love story, which initially made me a little uncomfortable, but I can see why he took this approach. Given Moroni was alone at the end of the Nephite era, this was a unique way to try to tell his story as who else would he talk to? I would have liked to see more of the historical context, but this take does do a pretty decent job of representing the character of Moroni and enough reference to portray the brutality of the time. I think a perfectly accurate portrayal of the Book of Mormon would be rated R for violence, but I think this depiction was tastefully done to give the idea but keep it family friendly. Great music and pretty good acting and cinematography for a lower budget film.","Jan 3, 2024",Laci G,3

All of it felt forced, and uninspiring. I honestly wish we would have left the theater early. But we both love the Book of Mormon, and kept holding onto hope that it'd get better.  My husband and I left with an empty feeling inside. We had to go home and watch something else to lift our spirits. The only thing that was decent was the music.

His passion for what he believes in, his patience and perseverance really says a lot about who he is and hat he stands for.

Angelina Jolie couldn't save this film but at least she tried to. On the other hand, I really liked the supporting actors: Thomas Jane was the only sexy thing in the whole movie as everyone's favourite sadistic bully. His character was loathsome, but there was some strength in Mr Jane's performance, I thought his Billy was the only one who cared about something. All he knew was violence, that's the way he was raised, and he expressed his ""love"" with violence. Very compelling performance.

I wasn't especially excited about the characters. Not that it needed a big name, but the main characters, including David Alan Grier, didn't do it for me.

a big fan of how quickly the story moves. Sometimes moves that don't have a bunch of car chases and shoot em moments can get really dull and long, not this one.

The cast is outstanding with scene stealers Martin Starr, Jocelyn DeBoer (yum) and the legend Stephen Root.  David Krumholtz is a lovably sour leading man in the mold of Larry David or Elliott Gould (think The Long Goodbye).  I enjoyed watching him work the script for all its sharp jabs with sprinkles of cringe.

I liked Trieste Kelly Dunn in Infinity Baby and she hits hard as Lousy's sister.  I've never wanted to share a vape with someone so badly.  Finally, my nominee for villain of the year goes to Shelby Surdam as the heartless billing specialist.  She slices Lousy where it hurts most.","Apr 2, 2024",Scott S,4

The soundtrack is sparse but supportive, without being a mood shaping distraction. The dialogue is intelligent and comedic in its portrayal of the empty, dysfunctional yet interesting characters.  There is no hand-wringing, screaming drama which would only have distracted from the precise articulations and interactions, rendered more entertaining by the calmness of the delivery.

The movie is not captivating, it's predtictable and boring sometimes. That means that there are exciting and funny moments too, which save this movie from being a complete disaster.

It's a pretty straightforward movie, one that moves along at a decent pace and tells its story well enough. Margaret Qualley and Geraldine Viswanathan give good performances, Qualley overacts a bit sometimes but as the film progressed I enjoyed her more and more. The editing is something I feel similarly about, some bits aren't the best imo.

The central idea- that a family values senator would be disgraced if a plaster cast of his penis became public- is just not plausible enough to base even a weak comedy on.

she_came_to_me,"NI LOS PLACERES DE LA VIDA REGALAN FELICIDAD HOY EN DÍA

En la última década y este acercamiento al siguiente lustro, cada vez más experimentamos y le damos mucha atención a la salud mental. Me parece estupendo, otras veces reflexiono sobre quién le da importancia a este problemático y manipulado, en varias ocasiones, estado mental. Nacen, últimamente, ciertas generaciones, a la que unas de ellas pertenezco, que decepcionan a las anteriores y plasman en la vida cotidiana ciertos valores imperdonables. Y generaciones cada vez más vagas, y de paladar seco en los placeres de la vida son las que nacen en estos días, que también se centran en su salud (depende de qué grupo social), algo que estoy totalmente de acuerdo, ya que yo lo experimento día tras día y me hace sostenerme fuertemente para intentar comprenderlo.


Y Llegó a mí, trata este problema. Pero reflejada en una mirada más experimentada, en una personalidad adulta. En la piel de Steven, protagonizado por Peter Dinklage, plasmado en un personaje reiterado, pero siempre interesante de conocer, de una manera más graciosa por sus momentos de reacción ante ciertas situaciones, que parecen darle miedo. Con Anne Hathaway como Patricia, una psicóloga de personalidad matrimonial seca y muy religiosa, junto a Marisa Tomei, desde las sombras, de personalidad excéntrica y mucha tasalomanía, Katrina.

Todo ocurre alrededor de Steve, que lleva varios años sin aparecer en el mundo de la Ópera, por un bloqueo como escritor. Patricia, por fin, le obliga a tomar el aire en un paseo y reflexionar, pero de repente todo se vuelve agobiante y a la vez pasional después de una noche ocurrente.

Nada me resulta abrumador en la melancólica y a la vez agitada película de Miller. Sin embargo, apartando secuencias interesantes y originales, todo lo demás ha sido muy experimentado con otros títulos. Pero no me disgusta, nos volvemos a adentrar en la conciencia del tema tratado aquí. No obstante, el avance de la película me suena débil, noto poco peso en una historia que iba a ser triangular, pero repentinamente ocurre la típica polémica parental del novio de la hija, todo lo relacionado con esta pareja adolescente me resulta prescindible y por muy interesante que me resulte este litigio que, hoy en día sigue ocurriendo (y que casi he experimentado) me apaga totalmente las fibras que me resultaban conmovedoras gracias a Dinklage y Steve. 

Su guion pretende ser intelectual pero se va por las ramas y necesita las características que plasma Woody Allen en sus personajes parecidos aquí a Steve. También deja huecos sin rellenar, y depende de qué película no me suele angustiar sino más bien enternecer. Aunque en este caso mi corazón y cerebro no son compatibles para saber si realmente Llegó a mí es de esas que hay alabar o simplemente verla una tarde aburrida de domingo.

road_house,"Unconventional plot, twists and non-twists, made me think it was trying for something different before the ending was wrapped up just like that and it felt like there was little meaning to it. Would have been a pretty good movie (4/5?) if not for the ending. Most of it was a fairly fun time! Pretty nice action too. Slower almost slice-of-life moments where Dalton grows with the side characters was a good change of pace. The movie made me want to see more growth between the side characters and Dalton because you could tell he was having an impact on their lives, and they to his life. However, the development of all the characters felt cut off. (Why didn't they go with a similar ending to the '89 original?)

SPOILERS: Dalton helps people with a terrible problem that they've been having for a while in the end but does so by going back down the path he wanted never to return to, the same path that made him want to end his life. Then he leaves just as lonely as he was in the beginning; he'll never be able to see those he cared for again- partially legal matters and partially because he thinks that by being there he'll just get them hurt again. 

I was honestly just disappointed and a little saddened in the ending. I really wanted to see Dalton have something to live for, but in the end it seems like while he will remember those he was happy with for a brief period, he knows he screwed his life up again terribly and believes he will never be free of his tendencies and the violence that surrounds him...","Apr 7, 2024",Garrett K,2

'Damsel' has the right ingredients but unfortunately fails to deliver. Millie Bobby Brown leads the cast in alright fashion, her performance in the lead role is serviceable. She is probably the only positive that I hold for this 2024 film sadly.

My main negative is the special effects, which are quite distracting throughout - barely any of it comes across as convincing. The dragon looks OK, but the way it moved sometimes didn't seem right. Speaking of that creature, Shohreh Aghdashloo is a neat piece of casting on paper, though her voice was not the most fitting in actuality. The lighting also felt odd.

On the cast, away from Brown, Robin Wright is very meh in her role, while Angela Bassett feels extremely wasted. There is, at least, a nice end credits song from the ace Lykke Li, ""Ring of Fire"" is admittedly incomparable to ""No Rest for the Wicked"" but it is pretty good all the same!","Apr 6, 2024",r96 s,2

www.rottentomatoes.com,"SPOLIERS: OK so let's do a little thought experiment. Let's say that there's an oil tanker out there that has a cult full of people you'd love to question and potentially immensely important computer data regarding an alien species that you'd like to acquire at all costs. You learn from satellite images that it has no visible weaponry, children routinely playing on the deck, and that it's heading down the Panama canal without escort in about a week. Do you:

A. Send in a stealth navy seal-like team to attempt to capture the cult leaders in the night and extract the information from the computers.

B. Go in heavy and capture all of the kids while they are playing outside and hold them ransom while you question the adults (less moral but probably more effective)

C. Just blow it up with conventional weapons.

Or do you:

D. Assemble a crack team of navy engineers to rush to build a completely untested, unproven, and extremely elaborate prototype weapon that will very slowly tear the ship, the equipment, and all of it's passengers - children included - into teeny tiny pieces.

This show, of course, goes with option D. Literally the stupidest option I could conceive of in my wildest dumbest dreams. Not only are you KILLING EVERYONE, meaning you can't question anybody, you are also DESTROYING all of the computers and equipment that you're hoping to get retrieve the data from. I could not believe what I was watching.

Of course by some miracle the exact hard drive they need doesn't get cut to bits with the rest of the ship. The lead investigator guy literally pulls it out from beneath the smoking carnage fully intact and is like ""We got it!"". /facepalm

I haven't read the book but if this is in it I would be SHOCKED. I'm guessing this is some Benioff / Weiss BS they made up similar to the end of GoT. 

The show has moments of brilliance which I'm guessing are from the book, and even more dumbness which I'm attributing to the show runners. All of the best stuff is front-loaded in the first three episodes, the rest are worth skipping. Give it a pass.","Apr 5, 2024",Justin C,1

migration_2023,"A masterpiece. I loved the animation, (then again, I watched this on a slide projector so what would I know?) The beginning of the movie you hear some dude telling a fairy tale about a couple of ducks that want to leave the pond. They died. Then it's revealed that it was dad duck telling the story and then the mom duck retells the story, so it doesn't scare the kids. Then the dad is Like NO! THEY DIED. They go back and forth like that for a while. Then a bunch of other stuff happens. I'll just say this part of the movie goes like this. Migration, NO, migration, NO, Migration, NO, Migration, YES
Then they go on a migration to Jamaica. Honestly the best parts of the movie are when the family is together. It's really a thing you only understand when you watch the movie. A bunch of other stuff happens, and they meet a bird called Chump. I don't really like chump. He feels bland. Probably cause all she does is show them the way to a guy who knows the way to Jamaica. I just wished they put in more character development into chump. Speaking of which I need to talk about our first encounter with ""the chef."" so chump shows them the way to a parrot who knows how to get to jamaica. He's trapped in a cage. But they CANT JUST LEAVE HIM THERE! So they try to get the key from some restaurant. I. LOVE. THIS. SCENE.
So the dad gets into the kitchen. And at first its more of a ""sneak.""  he hides behind frying pans. He hides in fruit And then they see the key. Also Can i mention how  creative this scene is? They use regular every they items to make this scene WAY more intriguing. Like for example. The fire hydrant. After a while he realises his wife was here as well. then, they find the key. To reach she streches out her body and steps on a fire hydrant. It goes crazy. and starts knocking things over. until the chef notices. Turning our sneak. Into a chase. they immediately start running for the exit. 
Its high stakes now. This scene is VERY climactic even though at the same time you know there gonna be fine Then they walk into a huge dance. Then they have to ""dance there way out"" And then they are fine. And they get back. Only for the green duck to ACCIDENTLY SWALLOW IT. They immediately start trying to get him to spit it out and as you guessed. They get it out ""Just in time""  And now the the parrot is free. and they make it out. Then its another cute 5 minute flying scene. With potty humor. I forgot this was an illuminations movie. And then they find ""duck heaven"" 
At first i thought this was gonna be some sort of cult but no. It was another excuse for an action scene. Honestly i dont think the chef should have been a reoccurring
 character but here we are.  then they fly. Another great action scene. They make it to jaimaca the end. Also i like the post credits scene. Good score. Good animation 4 out of 5","Mar 29, 2024",Caspian P,4

Me consume por dentro el futuro, y su pasado, que a la vez, una parte es nuestro presente. Temo el cambio a la vez que lo necesito y puede que lo agradezca. Odio descubrir otra película, u otra canción ¿en que me pueden afectar? Calma no me da, en absoluto, afecta en la experimentación de universos llenos de emociones y placer, y eso no me tranquiliza, lo quiero pero a la vez intento apartarlo de mí, porque dicen que la ignorancia te hace más feliz, pero al mismo tiempo no me siento a gusto e incluso inútil. Si tanto odio estas contradicciones es porque mientras noto felicidad, la tristeza interfiere, desde aspectos felices e incluso tristes, me ahogo en más melancolía. No me parece algo malo, me siento vivo, y, vuelvo a repetir, a la vez que muerto, ya no siento nada. 



Solo con un álbum, Tenorio Jr revolucionaría la música jazz creando una magia incomprensible de lo bonito que creaba. Lo mismo ocurre con los artistas que aparecen contando su relación con el protagonista, desde compañeros de la música hasta algún artista literario. Trueba y Javier aciertan en todo lo que le conviene a este magnífico e imparable drama político, también en esencia a un documental. Reparan los agujeros y heridas de lo desconocido y las ilógicas contradicciones del caso.

Javier Mariscal vuelve a conseguir un dibujo diferente al resto y conquistador, cómo en Chico y Rita (2010), destaca en su volúmen, colores y en general todo ese arte que le corresponde. El interés aquí podría terminar por muchos nombres e idiomas que se proyectan, pero lo que sostiene su atracción son la cantidad de declaraciones de los conocidos y la previsible conclusión de lo ocurrido, de tono arisco y tentándome a la misantropía. 

Una historia preciosa llena de tragedia que está tan bien narrada que salgo estupefacto, también algo desmoronado por la situación a la que se le sometió un hombre que daba vida a la música, que desprendía sabiduría y amor para aquellos con buen gusto. Él solo se iba a dedicar a tocar el piano y a sus seres queridos, sin la más mínima importancia a lo demás: la política. Él, cómo muchos otros, no ha muerto, solo se ha ido a por comida y una medicina para su chica, mientras tanto, le esperaremos escuchando su conmovedora música. Tan bella que reluce desde la oscuridad dónde lo mataron.","Oct 28, 2023",richie v,4

the_peasants,"An adaptation of a Nobel prize-winning novel from the makers of Loving Vincent using the same rotoscoped oil painting animation style, that's enough to be interested in this. But with the experience from Loving Vincent, they set out to make it even better. With dynamic camera movements that are meant to give an experience rooted in Polish culture and village life, this movie does an incredible job of immersing the viewers in this world. Kamila Urzedowska is incredible as Jagna, the village beauty, whose life is decided by others at every step yet can't take away her free-spiritedness, even with all the shackles. Even though, the story is a classic European village tragedy, the music and animation take it to another level. That ending sequence is just so incredibly shot and animated that it's impossible to not be moved after watching this. Much of the film would've been a lot harder to watch if it was live-action, even though it is quite hard even in this rotoscoped animated style.","Dec 12, 2023",Jithin K,4

green_fish,"Green Fish tells the story of  a man named Mak-dong, who returns home after service in the military. Trying to find a new job and some easy money (Plus a fascination with a woman named Mi-ae) he becomes involved with gangsters. Things seem to go well, but Mak-dong soon realizes he's in over his head as he falls in love with Mi-ae, who is the girlfriend of his boss. While the story seems cut and paste, Green Fish goes above this. Gangster life isn't glamorized, and it's more about Mak-dong as he tries to find his place in the world before realizing he's ensnared himself in such a dangerous situation. This isn't a film about the usual gangster film tropes, it remains a very character-oriented story that the viewer can sympathize and identify with, such as the scenes between Mak-dong and Mi-ae, as their relationship grows and they share hope of a better future away from all this. It feels very rare to this kind of glimpse into that world, and all the more reason Green Fish is such a marvelous and compelling drama.

[b]Green Fish [/b](Chang Dong-Lee, 1997): ah, life can be such a bitch. This is the director's debut, a slow and meditative film on the life of a confused, lost man. Makdong, a young and naive man who just got back from the army, finds his fate undefined and uncertain: as he returns home, he finds the dismembrement of his family, the decadence of his society. He ends up joining a group of city gangster who will eventually lead him to his disgrace. This film isn't very striking, it is not really original, but it's very well told: the director is clearly critiquizing the modern korean society, contrasting it to the old, traditional, family-driven society. The film moves deliberately, with occasional violent and emotional outbursts. The protagonist is well played by Suk-kyu Han, and the film improves when Kangho Song shows up. It's interestingly photographed, featuring a nostalgic score, but I just felt a little empty at the end. It's worth a watch, though.

[b]Blue Spring [/b](T. Toyoda, 2001): another hardcore social commentary, this time centered on Japan and its educational systems decadence. It's set in an average japanese high school. Now, I expectd some kind of [i]kids Return [/i]but this is way more shocking. I'm a bit skeptical about it: the vision of the education centers which is presented here is a bit scary, even disturbing. It's about a group of confused teens, product of a society which not only despises and ignores them, but also doesn't seem to encourage them to meet their goals. The troubled students, which lack emotional and educational support, end up choosing the wrong paths (such as joining the yakuza) or commiting insane acts. The film is shocking, extremely gritty (perhaps too much), but expertedly directed and well acted (Ryuheid Matsuda, known for his role on [i]Gohatoo[/i], stands out). Besides, the rock score fits very well in the film's tone. It's perhaps a bit extreme and not very subtle.

[b]Le Feu Follet [/b](L. Malle, 1963): this is my first experience with the french director, and I was quite impressed. This is quite possibly the best example of ""existentialist"" cinema I've come across: it's a captivating film of the last two days of the life of a man who, distrubed by the mediocrity of his life, decides to kill himself. Quite a desperate movie, throughoutly interesting but ultimately tragic: contains an impeccable visual look and a complex content which is worth discussing. I'm not sure if I was ready to see this movie, time will tell. Concerning the acting, kudos to Maurice Ronet for his flawless performance, which makes the lead feel believable; and it's always good to have Jeanne Moreau around. The extraordinarily simple piano score is worth mentioning as well.","Mar 9, 2011",Reviewer not found,3

   A few days ago I watched Lee Chang-dong's first film, and as expected the man continues to impress. That's three films of his I have watched now, each unique and wonderful in it's own way. '[b]Green Fish[/b]', as stated was his debut film so I expected the little rustiness that was on show. That said the opening thirty minutes grab you unlike '[b]Oasis[/b]' or '[b]Peppermint Candy[/b]' does. A noir of sorts yet with little emotion from the central character. The [i]'boy straight out of prison/army is looking for work, falls in with the wrong people and in love with the boss' girlfriend/wife/daughter'[/i] tale is woven as if on unworn ground, and simply the setting itself is refreshing. Similar to the more recent '[b]Memories of Murder[/b]', in the fact that it uses a quiet Korean suburbia on which to impose a well-known Hollywood genus with a twist. Some beautiful direction that ties in well with the script, such chemistry that is often overlooked nowadays. It involves a degree of synergy that only comes from the minds of writer/directors, who are unfortunately a dying breed in the film industry of today. None of these doubtful aspects can be applied to Korean cinema however. It is witnessing the peak of a golden generation of contributors, intent on serving up refreshing visions that draw upon experiences and imagination rather than the latest un-adapted comic book character.

green_fish,"Here is a look at one of South Korea's influential filmmakers with a reflective story to show. 

Director Chang-dong Lee and his down-to-earth ""Green Fish"" is amongst one of his greats including ""Peppermint Candy"" and his unforgettable ""Oasis."" It stars Suk-kyu Han (Solace, The Scarlet Letter) followed by Hye-jin Shim (Acacia) and Seong-kun Mun (Soo) where they play struggling characters filled with realistic circumstances that put a strain on their uncertain situations.

Synopsis: Mak-dong (Suk-kyu Han) is released from the military finding himself on a train ride singled out, unemployed and having to cope with common family matters. While searching for a women name Mi-ae after defending her honor from a handful of thugs (Hye-jin Shim) during the first day of his discharge, he bumps heads at mob boss Tae-gon Bae (Seong-kun Mun) who offers him encouraging guidance along with some legal work. While paying his dues and at the same time getting acquainted with the head chief's women, his life swerves into unsuspected situations. 

Although it requires a lot of patience when viewing this slow-paced tale, the wait is worth the watch for it's (not your average Joe) mobster approach. It focuses on true crime that carries much street-smart realism, frantic sacrifices and just plain old survival that normally surrounds gangster life in the real world as we see it today. For Mak-dong (Han) it's as simple as - do what you gotta do - to carry on in a place that he no longer recognizes after returning from the military. Despite it's wearisome with all that is happening, the characters seem to hold its own threw out the duration of the film. 

One of the most memorable scenes that I can sincerely remember is Suk-kyu Han's performance in the telephone booth that seemed to give a final needed piece to the story making the lead up as successful as it worked so hard to build. This follows up with a fairly predictable ending that still makes it all connect in an extraordinary way where even the biggest dreams can come to life at a whole other way.

Chang-dong Lee's ""Oasis"" stands as my all time favorite from him and ""Green Fish"" along with his other work clearly shows how effortlessly he can put something as real and profound as this work of art together.","Sep 8, 2008",Reviewer not found,3

A few very clever techniques such as the use of mirrors, cancelling out the necessity for shot/reverse shot cutting really highlight the skills on display here. The acting is phenomenol and is never too in your face or too subtle. The original music is a wonderfully gentle piece and any film that uses a Tom Waits song to great effect is bound to get high marks by me.","Dec 24, 2007",Reviewer not found,5

a_fragile_flower,"t's somewhat challenging to articulate precisely why this fails so spectacularly, not due to a scarcity of issues, but rather the overwhelming abundance of them.

The piece seems to attempt a fusion between the essence of a karaoke performer and the narrative depth of ""Her Life,"" yet the outcome is disastrously disheartening. The musical elements are particularly excruciating. The core of the issue lies in the film's inability to foster any connection with its characters, marred by inept scripting and storytelling. Additionally, the actions and motivations of the supposed ""cast"" defy any logical explanation throughout. The film's overall mood is baffling – one might wonder, is there an attempt at humor? Is there an underlying message or theme? Could it be classified as a drama? These questions remain unanswered, leaving viewers in a state of confusion even after the conclusion.","Apr 5, 2024",YLan N,0
a_fragile_flower,"So, like, I wanted to see this movie, right? And then I realized something crazy. All the songs in the movie are like, over 60 years old! These songs are from back when my grandma was still in Saigon. And then, I checked out the cast, and guess what? None of them are even close to my age. They all look young, but most of them are like, way over 60, and a few are in their 50s. This movie is totally for old people. And you know what? Like all old people stuff, it's super slow and hard to get. I just don't get old Vietnamese people. They're just so different, you know? And most of the time, they're totally out of touch with reality. They seriously should not have made this movie. There are way better topics for a movie than just two old ladies being jealous of each other.","Apr 4, 2024",Cindy M,0
a_fragile_flower,"My husband, a friend, and I went to watch a movie to support Vietnamese community films. Before it started, we took photos, admiring everyone's elegant outfits. But as the film began, my excitement turned to disappointment. The lead, Mai Thu Huyen, doesn't represent our overseas Vietnamese community but hails from Vietnam's communist new wealthy elite. This disconnect made it hard for us to relate to the movie. Additionally, the Music was a letdown I couldn't help but wonder why Thuy Nga wasn't involved in the project. The experience left me deeply dissatisfied, and I'm inclined to avoid movies from this production in the future.","Apr 4, 2024",Reviewer not found,0
a_fragile_flower,"This film is an absolute letdown, especially to the Vietnamese culture it attempts to portray. With a title that promises so much more, it utterly fails to deliver. There's no storyline to speak of - it's as if the concept of a plot was completely foreign to the creators. Watching paint dry might offer more entertainment and narrative structure. And the music? It's painfully worse than the warblings of a karaoke night gone wrong. Sitting through this movie is akin to throwing away $20 and two precious hours of your life, which you will never get back. It's as if someone took an amateur film project, devoid of skill or artistry, and somehow managed to get it on the big screen. It's not just a missed opportunity; it's a misstep into the realms of the unwatchable.","Apr 3, 2024",John N,1
a_fragile_flower,"""A Fragile Flower"" is a beautifully crafted film that shines a spotlight on the complexities of fame and human relationships, all through a uniquely Vietnamese lens. With standout performances, especially by Maya, and a soundtrack that perfectly encapsulates the protagonist's journey, the film offers a fresh take on the classic narrative of a rising star. Its optimistic portrayal of flawed characters striving for their dreams adds a heartfelt depth, making it a must-watch for fans of romantic dramas and those interested in the rich tapestry of Vietnamese cinema","Apr 2, 2024",Tutu T,5

the_sweet_east,"I'll be the first to admit it; the postmodern fairy tale sub-genre produces flops more often than not. That being said, The Sweet East felt surprisingly clear and complete in its vision and its execution. The film incorporates so many core elements of timeless folklore that are often smothered by the somewhat forced conventions of contemporary storytelling.

From the frantic transitional space between plot points to the exaggerated caricatures our protagonist collides with, The Sweet East offers up the same bewilderment and awe one might recall from their first reading of Alice In Wonderland; and to manufacture that feeling of otherworldly whimsy using only the overtly banal set pieces of our present day reality is an achievement in itself.

The impact-neutral events unfolding in their own private manias effectively maintain the ethereal veil between real and supersensory that can be so difficult to manage in a story like this one. A masterpiece of odd Americana with delightfully entertaining nods to some of our ugliest traits as a nation, The Sweet East encourages its audience to lean in a little closer to the depravities converging on screen with the same morbid curiosity of passing the aftermath of high speed highway collisions.

The main character, Lillian, is highly intelligent and capable for a child but clearly too confident for her own good, which adds a layer of authenticity and depth to her engagement with the world around her. The way she assimilates anecdotal elements of her counterparts into bits of dialogue here and there is so honest to the teenage experience.

The rogues gallery of perverts and weirdos that surface throughout the film is too extensive to catalog; but they all seem to effortlessly straddle that line of credible and uncanny throughout their screen time. It's remarkable how the individual humanities of each character permeate the chaotic fluidity of how the narrative functions. I found myself investing in characters I deeply disliked on a personal level and, to me, that is how any decent villain/goon/ne'er-do-well should aim to register with the audience.

On a personal note I will say I very much appreciate the way they nail the impotent over-quality of the Baltimore (and largely the American) DIY punk scene, and I MUST mention that any film that yields a climactic plot point to Gibby Haynes is worth the price of admission on that merit alone. I also appreciate a return to the lost art of an opening credits sequence. Even the sudden redirect of a musical intro somehow works.

The Sweet East feels like the quintessential contemporary fairy tale; investigating harsh truths about ourselves that may one day fade into the obscurity of legend in their own right. It scavenges enchantment from the debris of our mundane tedium which feels romanticized just enough so as to not become too self-indulgent.","Jan 20, 2024",Jack L,4
the_sweet_east,"Great movie!  The hero's journey never ends in this one.  the main character's arc never evolves because she's stunted by her own selfishness and narcissism.  That's a subtle commentary on contemporary America, where tribal affiliation and ability to spout off the right ideological buzz-words matter more than substantive character or genuine spiritual ties to the country.  She's a wayward soul, drifting through an ideological hellscape of warring tribes squabbling over the scraps of power a dying empire can still afford them.","Dec 20, 2023",Oliver C,4

I wasn't especially excited about the characters. Not that it needed a big name, but the main characters, including David Alan Grier, didn't do it for me.

It's like Jia Ling shedding off 110 pounds—so many people saying she relied on a team and technology, conforming to low standards of beauty, succumbing to body shaming culture. But who cares? Le Ying, with all her confidence, is thriving, and Jia Ling, in her evening gown, is radiant. Every wrinkle on her face exudes confidence; she's the real winner!

I see it as a gripping revenge story, not just about the protagonist Le Ying seeking vengeance, but also about actress Jia Ling's retaliation. When Le Ying hit the ground, I not only witnessed the replayed malice towards her but also the years of various entertainment shows mocking Jia Ling with remarks like 'since you're fat, it's okay to mock you.' And even after its release, the venomous words driven by jealousy and fear of girl power continued. With one swift left punch, let them all go to hell! 👊","Mar 16, 2024",Sunny G,5

The main character showed cowardness, weakness, reluctance and all traits a normal person has. The acting is great - not Oscar great, but touching, empathetic and moving. The storytelling is also impressive - I like how it reveals some of the dark moments in the end where all emotions and feelings peaked. The ending, no the ending is not tacky like ""she is living the dream and everything is amazing for her now"". Instead, it connects back to her initial plan, which was always to win just once in her own way. 
This movie makes me think how we define our lives and our wins. Most importantly, how we shape our happiness.

yolo,"Really really like it. My minor and only complaint is I wish there's some more ""blank space"" to the story but this doesn't affect how I resonate with this film. It's not about fat loss, probably not even about boxing; it's more about how you fight for yourself.","Mar 15, 2024",Gary L,5

household_saints,"Being second generation Italian-American, with a Father who was famous for his scrumptious homemade sausage, going to Catholic School, living in these time periods, and loving Puccini--well, I have to admit y perspective on this film is bound to be a bit skewed. That said, I strongly believe 50% of the critics have messed up on this one.  The story evolves as half-reality, half-myth, with a heavy does of nostalgia for a time not so long ago, rendering it capable of being read in any way that a viewer might want to. Believers will adore its quiet intensity, in the character of the young girl/woman brought to life in a tour de force by the wonderful Lilly Taylor. Non-believers will on board with her anti-religion father (at least until the last few minutes), another great job of acting by the talented Vincent D'Onofrio.  Yet the real acting surprise here is comedian Tracy Ullman who was able to transform herself into a very believable and sensitive portrayal of a shy and sheltered young Italian-American woman
going through profound transformation in the two decades through which the story unfolds.  I was precisely the same age as Teresa Santangelo at the time the Pope was supposed to reveal the Third Prophecy at Fatima (believers convinced that the Virgin Mary appeared to 3 simple farm children revealing great secrets, the first of two which proved to come true); like her, I was greatly disappointed when he chose not to reveal it. Rumors still abound as to the reason why. But its importance in the story is that this propels the little girl Teresa into the young adult with a hyper-religiosity which rules the rest of her life. There is great comedy in the scene where a somewhat bawdy yet polite young Jesus appears to her and causes her to see hundreds of checkered shirts like the one she is ironing for her creepy and overenthusiastic boyfriend. It returns near the end where she describes God the Father as a fan of the very same thumb-scale tilting and cheating at pinochle that marks her own father. Throw in the marvelous Grandmother from the Old Country, with her strange beliefs that the uneducated had back there, and the fact that her father ""wins"" her mother as his wife in the one pinochle game that he did not cheat at (drawing nothing but hearts, a mathematical absurdity), and that Teresa may very well have become a modern version of the very Saint that she modeled her life after, and I see a marvelous story, told with verve and imagination, sensitive and touching while believing in itself. Ignore the critics and listen to me--this is a gem that should not be missed, even now 24 years after its release.","Mar 7, 2017",Reviewer not found,5

Remixes were used and produced beautifully. And ofc Naina song was like a perfect ending to this crime comedy. 🤍
If u want to laugh and enjoy , do go and watch it 🤍
I feel like watching it again. 
That vijay malya in parallel universe😭 and then how the ladies dig a plan to take revenge. All those cussings out of Tabu's mouth felt like sugar lemme tell u. Kareena being a sassy one and kriti yet learning to be sassy like her partners but soft hearted. I would love to see this trio again srsly. 
They came up such a strong, sassy, sexy and charming presence at the same time. Diljit and kapil also played their parts well and everybody in the supporting roles and off camera were awesome. Cast was selected beautifully. Kudos to the entire team.

crew_2024,"An entertaining watch, but slightly overhyped in my opinion. Still a very good movie and I would recommend it for any die hard Bollywood fans like myself. It gets better after the interval. 

Entertainment: It doesn't really get boring ever, as I never found myself picking up my phone. Pretty funny too. Overall 3/5. 

Message: it has a subtle social message too, but is clearly targeted primarily as a comedy film. I personally do not care much about social messages so I will not give a rating on this aspect. 

Music: the music is a 2.5/5; while it's pleasant, it doesn't match up to recent Bollywood standards. 

Acting: all 3 ladies did a good job with their roles, but Tabu was definitely the star of the film. Kapil Sharma and Diljit were slightly unremarkable, but did their roles well nevertheless. The cast overall is good.","Apr 1, 2024",Ilyaan K,3
crew_2024,"When the boss of the airline in the movie is Vijay Walia, you know who is being hinted at. Well, Crew is about an airline company, Kohinoor, that has not paid their employees for months, and are rapidly moving towards bankruptcy. With no solution in sight, three airhostesses take up gold smuggling to make ends meet. 

Crew had potential. I was pumped to watch this from the time they announced the cast. The leading ladies are extremely talented actors and they don't disappoint. Their chemistry is what holds the film together. And for me, Tabu's performance is what worked the best. Kriti Sanon and Kareena Kapoor have their moments. Rajesh Sharma, Saswata Chatterjee, Diljit Dosanjh & Kapil sharma co-star.

Crew doesn't disappoint. It is entertaining, keeps you engaged throughout with the not-so-brilliant schemes of the three air hostesses. And watching the three onscreen shows how much fun they had making this film. And I had wonderful time watching it.","Apr 1, 2024",arvind s,3

ghostbusters_frozen_empire,"Massive Ghostbuster fan here, it was my first fandom. I recently re-watched GB: Afterlife, which I really enjoyed, to prepare for this movie and I have to say it was not on par with the former installment. It was fun and there was some nostalgia (sometimes too much which was a distraction), but it was a very disjointed plot with too much going on. I think the main problematic factor was it didn't get to the actual big baddie until the very end and it ended with me wanting more. Basically the ultimate threat level didn't match what people had been saying about him the whole movie. Also, I haven't seen many people mention this, but I guess we're going to gloss over the fact that a character temporarily offs herself so she can hang out with a ghost ""friend""? That was a really odd choice. I also don't recall very many memorable musical cues, which is atypical for the Ghostbuster movies. A tighter plot, bigger threat and more action would have made this a great movie, but it was just ok. I don't know if I'll re-watch it nearly as much as I do the other installments.","Apr 7, 2024",Braden A,3

ghostbusters_frozen_empire,"I enjoyed Afterlife well enough, but I feel like this movie gives this new generation of Ghostbusters much more a life and direction of their own without relying as heavily on nostalgia. It definitely has its fair share of callbacks and nostalgia, but for the most part it wasn't too disruptive to the movie (though could've done without some). The movie is a bit flawed, the pacing could have used some work to let some important character development have more time and give the villain more real time as a threat. Overall, though, I had a great time with the movie. It was great to see the OG cast living their lives and being more than cameos.

With an air of anticipation akin to the unveiling of a grand tapestry, I embarked upon this odyssey of moving pictures, only to find myself ensnared within a maelstrom of mediocrity. Verily, the plot unfurls like a tangled skein, weaving a narrative so convoluted that even the most astute of scholars would find themselves lost amidst its labyrinthine machinations.

In truth, 'Madame Web' doth serve as a veritable magnum opus of disappointment, a cacophony of cinematic sins that assail the senses with all the subtlety of a rampaging herd of swine. From its lackluster performances to its insipid dialogue, every facet of this cinematic endeavor doth conspire to transform what could have been a masterpiece into naught but a hot pile of dog dudu.

madame_web,"I think this is the worst cinecomic in history. During the duration of the entire film nothing happens with scenes where the camera moves randomly making you feel bad. All the characters are flat without in-depth analysis. The film does not give explanations of any kind about what is happening. In addition, the film has a very badly done CGI. I think it's even worse than the Morbius movie which at least in that movie had scenes that made you laugh and that became memes","Apr 3, 2024",Alessandro Ramon T,0
madame_web,"Loved this, as someone unfamiliar with the comic I found the movie very entertaining. Would love to see what happens after this.","Apr 3, 2024",Jonathan P,5
madame_web,82% didn't hate it i heard the worse things but for me yes some parts of the cgi was ok but i liked the lead in the movie i wish there were spider-man easter eggs it's very frustrating that there isn't and the villain is stupid he gets hit by everything which has me laughing my asf in the theater i just wish sony cared about the source material bc ik they could be better and the movie should of put her in her suit definitely a complaint i had the whole movie i enjoyed the lead and the future past thing they did,"Apr 3, 2024",Joseph Tutorials,3
madame_web,"When it comes to ""Madame Web,"" I've noticed there's been a bit of a stir, but honestly, I'm a bit puzzled by all the fuss. It seems like some folks went in expecting the usual Marvel roller coaster, but here's the thing—I'm all for mixing it up. Why settle for the same old plots when we can explore something new, right?

Personally, I found ""Madame Web"" to be a breath of fresh air. Sure, it had a few moments where things felt a bit offbeat, but doesn't every movie? These little quirks didn't spoil my fun; if anything, they added a unique flavor to the whole experience.

The movie really shines by stepping off the beaten path and giving us something different from the Marvel universe. And let's be real, in a world teeming with superhero tales, bringing something new to the table isn't just nice—it's necessary.

All in all, ""Madame Web"" was a pretty enjoyable ride for me. It's a reminder that there's room in the superhero genre for all kinds of stories, and I'm here for it. The movie might not hit the mark for everyone, but it's definitely a bold step in a refreshing direction.","Apr 2, 2024",Dana P,5
madame_web,"Los verdaderos fans de Marvel ,disfrutamos la película y valoramos, el que hayan echo una película,en versión ficticia y real de personajes tan icónicos de Marvel , nunca hago un crítica, en ninguna película, ni nada por el estilo ,pero hay que parar, con creernos cineastas y con creer que podría ser mejor de lo la an realizado ,detrás de ello hay un gran trabajo de actores, actrices,guionistas,directores,realizadores etc Y ya cansa que le busquen un pero a todo y realmente ,quién se está cargando, todas las sagas ,películas ,series etc es la audiencia ,que después ,veo las quejas de cancelaciones de películas ,cancelaciones de series etc y después decimos, que esta generación es de cristal, noooo, la generación de cristal ,somos los adultos ,mientras los niños y adolescentes, disfrutan de las películas sin un pero olé por esos fans que vamos a disfrutar de una película y agradecemos,poder disfrutar ,en versión real de nuestros personajes icónicos y para terminar me gustó mucho ese cambio de visión más cómica y estás nuevas historias","Apr 2, 2024",corina g,5
madame_web,"Awful, just awful!
Terrible directing, even worse writing and mediocre acting and visual effects make this film one of the worst I've ever seen.","Apr 2, 2024",andrigames119,1
musica,"At it's core, it may be a pretty regular RomCom. But the cultural and personal/musical lens it's told through has a unique feeling to it. The direction and strong editing transport you directly into Rudy's world and his way of seeing everything. A remarkable debut.","Apr 7, 2024",Tobias K,4

A funny, sweet, and moving romcom. 
Clearly made with pure soul and passion. 
It is entertaining, artistic, touching, hilarious. 
I think it'd be great on stage, produced by Lin Manuel. 
It has the perfect flow…and it is wonderfully weird.

musica,A sweet and light story that exceeded any expectations.  This film is a big hug for all Brazilians and their descendants around the world.  It was a non-stereotypical representation that made me very proud.,"Apr 6, 2024",Daniel M,5
musica,"This movie was funny, diverse, and original. I especially liked the use of movement, language, music, and set designs. The main character was charming and authentic, but there could have been more conflict. Overall, this movie kept me smiling. It was kind of like watching a musical play without the singing, but somehow it worked!","Apr 6, 2024",Sparks T,4
musica,"I heard an interview with director/lead/composer of this film and I watched the film the next day. Had I not heard the interview, I'm not sure if I would have understood or liked the picture as much as I did. He gave a name for what his brain did that is some real thing that the character has .  Setting that aside, the film is imaginitive, sweet and fun.  I kinda of feel that it would work better as a stage play on Broadway. It is partially shot like one. I loved the dancing and Camila is really great as the fish monger love interest. His real life mom plays his mom and she is fantastic. Watch this! It's fun, heartfelt and super creative. The music is top shelf. 
Enjoy!","Apr 6, 2024",Laura B,5
musica,"An absolute masterpiece. Been following Rudy for a decade - it is incredible to see him be able to ""take it higher"" - from Vine to YouTube to the big screen. Every part of this movie is infused with Rudy's creativity and talent. I truly hope this earns the awards and success it absolutely deserves!","Apr 6, 2024",Emily G,5
musica,"Maravilhoso! Que lindo ver o Brasil sendo representado com a beleza e respeito que merece! It was great to watch this movie and see this brasilidade, our songs (""canta canta minha gente, deixa a tristeza pra lá... que a vida vai melhorar"") and also Camila saying ""eita"" 💜.
Love it!! Great Rudy!","Apr 5, 2024",Jaqueline S,5

Liked that it could be seen by families with children, though I do think preteen age or older to comprehend most of it. Some was a bit far-fetched, but mostly palatable. Most of all it is great storytelling.","Apr 6, 2024",Reviewer not found,5
